00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.193
The answer is this one,
220 is less than 229, or 239.

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:10.117
Take it out the front here,
put it on explored.

00:00:10.117 --> 00:00:15.629
Add in two more paths, then sum them up.

00:00:15.628 --> 00:00:23.579
So 220 plus 146 is 366 and

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:30.164
220 plus 97 is 317.

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:35.143
Okay and now notice that we're closing
in on Bucharest we've got two neighbors

00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:36.118
almost there.

00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:39.578
But neither of them has their turn yet
Instead,

00:00:39.578 --> 00:00:44.862
the cheapest path is this one over here,
so move it to the explored list.

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:49.593
Add 70 to the path cost so

00:00:49.593 --> 00:00:53.682
far and we get 299.

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:58.730
Now the cheapest node is 239 here so

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:05.840
we expand finally into
Bucharest at a cost of 460.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.743
And now the question is, are we done?

00:01:08.743 --> 00:01:09.977
Can we terminate the object?

00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:11.908
