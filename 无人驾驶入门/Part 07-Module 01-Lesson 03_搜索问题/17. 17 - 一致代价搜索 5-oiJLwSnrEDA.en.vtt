00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:05.339
The answer is no, we're not done yet.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.304
We have reached a goal state.

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:11.599
We put a path onto the frontier that reaches the goal Bucharest,

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.399
but we haven't popped that path off the frontier.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.780
And uniform costs search continues to search until we pop it off the frontier.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.810
We continue looking to see if there's a better path that also reaches the goal.

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:28.140
So, let's see I forgot to say Fagaras is explored,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.969
so let's continue looking on the frontier,

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.475
the cheapest now is here at 299.

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:37.185
We'll expand that.

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:40.910
We get a path of cost 374.

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.519
Put that on the frontier.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.609
Now let's go again.

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.350
Now the cheapest path is over here at 317,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.484
we'll mark that as explored,

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.200
and add two more pass, one here,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.585
that's a worse path,

00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:57.064
so it gets dropped,

00:00:57.064 --> 00:01:01.009
and one path that also reaches the goal,

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:05.575
and that has a total cost of 418.

00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:07.579
So that just shows it's a good thing we waited,

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:12.064
a good thing we didn't stop when we found the first path to the goal

00:01:12.064 --> 00:01:18.079
because now this second path found is actually cheaper than the first path found.

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.689
But we're not going to stop here because we still haven't popped

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.155
off a path that reaches the goal. So we'll continue.

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:30.379
What's next, now the cheapest path on the frontier is here at 366.

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:37.129
We expand that and we get past that or worse paths to points we've already seen before.

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.239
So nothing new goes on the frontier.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:43.774
Next, the cheapest path on the frontier is at 374,

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:48.290
again expanding that leads nothing useful,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.245
only worse paths than we've seen before.

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:58.790
And now, finally, the cheapest path on the frontier is this 418 path to Bucharest.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.525
So we pop that off and now we reach the goal and now we stop.

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:06.635
So even though we found the 460 path first,

00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:09.259
we don't stop there because there might be

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.114
another path that also reaches the goal that's cheaper.

00:02:12.115 --> 00:02:17.985
We keep on going until we pop path off of the frontier that reaches the goal,

00:02:17.985 --> 00:02:24.000
and that's why uniform cost search is guaranteed to find the cheapest path to the goal.
