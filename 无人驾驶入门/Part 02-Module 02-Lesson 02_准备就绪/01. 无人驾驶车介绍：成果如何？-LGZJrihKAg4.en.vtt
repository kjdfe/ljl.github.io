00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.774
Hopefully you not only enjoyed Carla and her friends adventure,

00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:04.884
but you learned a little something about your skills.

00:00:04.884 --> 00:00:07.344
If you felt like that was really easy, great.

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:09.439
Sounds like you are ready to dive into the content.

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:10.785
If you struggled a little bit,

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:12.669
no worries, that is why we are here.

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.009
At the end of this orientation,

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.815
we will give you some resources that you can check out before the classroom opens.

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:20.320
Use these refresher math and programming skills.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.955
Again none of it is required.

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:25.000
We just want to help you be successful and graduating this program.
