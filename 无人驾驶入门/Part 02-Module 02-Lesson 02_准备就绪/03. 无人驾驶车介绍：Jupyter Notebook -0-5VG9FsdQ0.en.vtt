00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
Immediately after this video,

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:04.339
you're going to see something that looks like this.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.275
And this is called a Jupyter Notebook.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:11.135
It is a great tool for writing and documenting Python code.

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:13.934
So, as you can see, this notebook is made of cells.

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:16.024
And I've got a cell highlighted now,

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:20.304
and I can use my arrow keys to navigate up and down to the cells.

00:00:20.304 --> 00:00:22.439
And this cell, as you can see here,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.490
is a markdown cell.

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.494
And I don't want to talk too much about this except to say that markdown

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:30.660
is a sort of fancy way to make text look a little nicer.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.340
So, sometimes you'll see

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.245
these cells in this format and this can be a little bit annoying.

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:38.814
And if you don't know what to do, it can be a big problem.

00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:40.949
Basically, this format is showing you the editing mode.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.145
So here, you can see the syntax for making something a header.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:48.525
And here, you can see the syntax for making something bold.

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:52.229
If you ever wind up in this mode and you want to get back to the nicer looking mode.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:53.789
So just like control and enter,

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.079
works in markdown cells.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.664
We can also look at a code cell.

00:00:56.664 --> 00:01:00.435
And here, we have a python comment followed by a print statement.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:03.330
And I can do control and enter here.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.239
And sure enough, it printed, "Hello World!"

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:08.515
Now, there's actually another way you can run a cell and

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:11.125
that's by pressing shift and enter.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:15.930
And that does the same thing except it advances your cursor down to the cell below.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.360
That's actually really nice.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.295
So, when you see a notebook like this one and you start at the top,

00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:22.674
you can just kind of advance through by pressing shift enter,

00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:24.689
shift enter, shift enter.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.750
And I'm going to let you play with this more on your own.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.734
But there are two important things I do want to say first.

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:33.239
Number one: this is your workspace.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.369
You can do whatever you want in these notebooks.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.130
You will not cause any lasting damage.

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:39.239
There's nothing to break.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:42.119
So, for example, I could go here and let's say,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.230
I want to delete every single cell for some reason.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.730
I'm going to press the D key twice to delete the cell.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.570
And I'm going to do that on every single one. All right.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.229
So, all my cells are gone.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.594
I could even save it.

00:01:56.594 --> 00:01:57.959
Now, you may think we've caused

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.474
lasting damage and we'll never be able to return to this exercise.

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:01.659
But that is not true.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.704
Down here in the bottom, we select Menu and then go to reset data.

00:02:05.704 --> 00:02:07.859
And it looks ominous, but it's okay.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.564
We just type in Reset data to confirm.

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:13.229
The reason it's so hard to delete is because,

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:14.394
you know, this is your workspace.

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:16.515
You may have a lot of work on here that you don't want to delete.

00:02:16.514 --> 00:02:19.594
So, we just want to be sure that you don't do anything you don't want to do.

00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:23.580
But sure enough, after we reset data, we're back to where we started.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.895
So, that's the first thing I wanted to say.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:26.600
You cannot cause lasting damage.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.409
And the second I want to say is that,

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.539
again, this is really your workspace.

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:32.939
You can even create new files. You can do whatever you want.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.639
So, I'm going to create a new notebook in Python 3.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.074
Maybe I'll call it math_practice.

00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:41.629
And I can play around Python code.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.984
Let's try two plus two.

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:45.745
Sure enough, it's equal to four.

00:02:45.745 --> 00:02:50.230
And I can browse all of my files by clicking on this Jupyter logo.

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:54.750
Oh, it's prompting me to stay because I haven't saved my changes. That's good.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.245
Let me go through that process of saving the changes.

00:02:58.245 --> 00:03:00.560
And I can click on the Jupyter logo again.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.810
And now, I can see all of my files,

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.905
math_practice and playground are both here.

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:08.694
So I can click on playground and I'm back here.

00:03:08.694 --> 00:03:10.194
All right. I just wanted to show you those few things.

00:03:10.194 --> 00:03:12.959
You'll learn more as you play around in this programming playground and you'll

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.000
learn more about how to use this tool throughout the end of the degree. Have fun.
