00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.464
We can now going to dive and learn about Gaussians. 

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:06.299
Carl Friedrich Gauss lived about 20 years ago,

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.714
measured the country and turned it into maps.

00:00:08.714 --> 00:00:11.129
And in doing so, he had to confront this innovation he was

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.000
making small but significant measurement errors.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.870
So these measurements wouldn't in fact fit together.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.839
So, he invented a way to characterize

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.585
measurement errors that looks like this bell curve you might have seen before.

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:24.608
That's called a Gaussian.

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:30.089
And that concept has been essential to statistics for over 200 years,

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.479
and it's very fundamental to self-driving cars.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:35.664
But rather than just lecturing the math,

00:00:35.664 --> 00:00:37.990
what we can do with you, we can let you play with data.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.234
You're going to take lots and lots of small probabilities and things,

00:00:41.234 --> 00:00:43.375
and in the map and compute the mean,

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:50.000
and what comes out will look surprisingly like this bell shaped curve. So let's dive in.
