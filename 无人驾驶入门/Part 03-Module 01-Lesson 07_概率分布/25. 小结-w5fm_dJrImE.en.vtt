00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.061
So you just learned about the concept of a

00:00:02.061 --> 00:00:04.701
probability density and that’s very cool.

00:00:04.701 --> 00:00:06.963
You now know what a uniform density is, you’ve

00:00:06.963 --> 00:00:09.233
encountered a new type of density that have a

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.318
step in the middle and later in this class we

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:13.340
will see densities that are very funny like

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.571
this one over here called the Gaussian.

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.760
We get back to this after we talked about large

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.636
numbers and something funky called the

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:24.636
central limit theorem or CLT.
