00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
You've seen how autonomous vehicles

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.144
sense their environments and then use that information

00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:07.319
to lower their uncertainty and improve

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.405
their predictions about a car's movement and surroundings.

00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:15.230
But how do autonomous vehicles actually represent uncertainty in the real world?

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.719
They use probability and probability distributions.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:21.960
Probability distributions are a mathematical way to

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.940
represent uncertainty across all possible outcomes.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.605
For example, in the case of locating a vehicle,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:32.640
the possible outcomes are all the places where the vehicle could be.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.865
When a vehicle first turns on the car has no idea where it is.

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:40.440
How do you think you could represent this initial uncertainty mathematically?
