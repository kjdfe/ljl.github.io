00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:02.545
And, now, comes the hard part. I want you to

00:00:02.545 --> 00:00:04.825
calculate the actual density. We know that the

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:08.994
density for the birth time to be before noon is

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:13.033
twice as large as the density for being born

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.257
after noon. So, here is my density function,

00:00:16.257 --> 00:00:20.802
time of day X, Nf of X and youâ€™ve already

00:00:20.802 --> 00:00:22.657
identified the shape. And, thereâ€™s now two

00:00:22.657 --> 00:00:26.200
parameters, A and B. I want you to figure out

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.952
for me what A is and what B is, assuming that

00:00:29.952 --> 00:00:34.497
the basic unit here is in hours. Put differently,

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:39.387
there is 24 hours horizontally in this interval

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:40.674
. As a hint, make sure that the

00:00:40.674 --> 00:00:44.011
area underneath sums up to 1.
