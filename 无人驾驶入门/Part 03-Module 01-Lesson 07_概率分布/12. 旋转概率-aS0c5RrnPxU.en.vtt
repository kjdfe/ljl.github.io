00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:01.956
This is a more common example; it’s called the

00:00:01.956 --> 00:00:04.509
wheel of fortune. We’re twisting an object like

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.092
a bottle, or like a pen and then it arrives at a

00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:10.624
specific angle. We all know that angles go

00:00:10.624 --> 00:00:13.707
between zero and 360 degree. So let’s take a

00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:16.549
specific angle. What is the probability that our

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:20.549
object has the very precise angle 180 degrees?
