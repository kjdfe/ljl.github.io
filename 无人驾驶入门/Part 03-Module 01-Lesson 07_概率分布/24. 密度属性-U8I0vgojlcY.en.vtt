00:00:00.252 --> 00:00:02.723
And, this is a really tricky question. So,

00:00:02.723 --> 00:00:05.545
clearly, densities don’t have to be positive

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:07.694
everywhere. It suffices to be non-negative

00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:09.754
and I gave you examples where outside of

00:00:09.754 --> 00:00:12.970
certain interval density was zero. Zero is not

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.920
positive. Zero is just non-negative. Now,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.130
densities don’t have to be continuous. I gave

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.021
you an example of a density like this. And,

00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:22.223
over here where the density jumped, you had

00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:24.941
a point of discontinuity. So, continuous is

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:26.892
not correct. And, if you got this wrong,

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.359
no big deal. The word continuous might not

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.057
even mean much to you. But, it’s one of these

00:00:30.057 --> 00:00:33.001
things to know about densities. Now, smaller

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.576
or equal to 1, that’s a really tricky one. And, I

00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:37.825
would submit that’s not correct and here’s why.

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:41.825
Suppose you have a density that assigns

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:44.625
uniform probability only to values between 0

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:49.674
and 0.1, then the height of this density could

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:53.743
be 10; it’s 1 over 0.1. And, as a result, it’s

00:00:53.743 --> 00:00:56.856
possible that densities can exceed 1. And

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.393
that is a key point that makes them different

00:00:58.393 --> 00:01:00.445
from probabilities. Probabilities are always

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:04.000
smaller than or equal to 1. Densities can be larger than 1.
