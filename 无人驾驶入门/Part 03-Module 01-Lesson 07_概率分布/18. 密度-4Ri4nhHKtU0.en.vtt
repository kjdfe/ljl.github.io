00:00:00.146 --> 00:00:02.395
So, I’m now going to teach you a concept that

00:00:02.395 --> 00:00:05.830
is very deep, called the density of a probability.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.647
And it’s kind of like a probability for continuous

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:12.178
spaces but not exactly. It’s just a good motivator

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.938
to think of a density as a – of a probability for

00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:16.011
continuous spaces. Let’s take the bottle

00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:18.933
example. We know that the outcome of turning

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:23.363
the bottle lies between 0 and 360 degrees.

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:25.636
So, given what we learnt, you want to assign

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:27.915
0 to anything outside that range but inside

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:32.900
this range, we’d love to give a value and say,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.148
look, there is a function here that renders

00:00:35.148 --> 00:00:39.250
every outcome in this interval equally likely.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.700
So, you’re going to construct this function for

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.762
So, you’re going to construct this function for c

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:45.731
number one, each outcome in the range of 0

00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:48.323
to 360 has an equal value, and, constraint

00:00:48.323 --> 00:00:52.593
number two, the area under this function sums

00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:57.558
up or integrates to 1 which means this area

00:00:57.558 --> 00:01:00.576
over here is just 1. So, tell me what is this

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:05.935
function for X’s that are between 0 and 360

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:07.863
degrees. There is a single numerical value

00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:11.000
that goes in here and you have to guess it.
