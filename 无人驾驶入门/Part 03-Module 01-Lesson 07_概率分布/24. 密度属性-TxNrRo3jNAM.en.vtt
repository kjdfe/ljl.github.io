00:00:00.131 --> 00:00:02.589
Let me ask another trick question and that’s

00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:05.573
somewhat academic. For function f to qualify

00:00:05.573 --> 00:00:07.806
as an entity which of the conditions have to

00:00:07.806 --> 00:00:10.821
be fulfilled: has to be positive, non-negative,

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:14.540
continuous, and smaller or equal to 1? Check

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.455
any or all that apply including the ‘none of

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:21.255
above’ if you believe none of those apply.
