00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:02.037
So let’s now redefine how to treat continuous

00:00:02.037 --> 00:00:05.121
distributions, here is our circle again and

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:07.057
here is the bottle that we are spinning.

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:09.922
Let’s call the outcome X, that’s the final

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:13.338
angle at which the bottle arrives. Tell me

00:00:13.338 --> 00:00:16.023
what’s the probability that X is between

00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:20.023
zero and 180 degrees? Put your answer here.
