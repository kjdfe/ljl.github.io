00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.155
Now we talk about probability distributions.

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:07.035
A probability distribution is the way in which

00:00:07.035 --> 00:00:11.789
a self-driving car represents its internal beliefs about the world.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.654
So when a car for example sees a tree,

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:18.059
then internally it is a probability distribution to represent

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:23.000
its belief of the chances it's facing a tree. So let's dive in.
