00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
If you have no idea where a car is located in the world

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:08.464
the probability distribution for its location will look completely flat.

00:00:08.464 --> 00:00:10.980
The probability of it being anywhere say in

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.845
San Francisco or in Tokyo will be the exact same.

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:18.060
The probability that the car will be at any particular location will

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.839
be a constant value that's the same at every location.

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.359
So the probability distribution can be represented

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.059
by a constant horizontal line on a graph,

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.250
that shows the probability of all of these outcomes.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.009
But as we gather more information,

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.009
this distribution will change.

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:36.989
Say we get a GPS sensor reading that tells

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.690
us that we're a lot closer to San Francisco than to Tokyo.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:43.019
The location probability goes up near

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.390
the GPS measurement and the probability

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.785
goes down in regions far from the GPS measurement.

00:00:48.784 --> 00:00:51.569
And even though the GPS signal isn't perfect you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.100
have more information about the likely location of your car.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.439
The vehicle is never 100 percent sure of its location,

00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:01.954
yet through sensing the vehicle increases its certainty.

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:04.739
The shape of the probability distribution tells you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.375
the most likely locations and the least likely locations of the vehicle.

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:14.819
Probability distributions are really useful ways to visualize and represent uncertainty,

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:17.609
not just in single vehicle localization

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.655
but also in tracking the locations of pedestrians,

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:24.019
bicycles and other moving vehicles around a car.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:29.304
These distributions are also used in representing uncertainty in sensor measurements.

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:32.940
Remember that autonomous vehicles are robots on wheels.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.649
So everything from sensing,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.840
measuring and moving will involve some uncertainty.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.930
So, in this lesson you're going to learn how to

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.165
draw and interpret probability distributions.

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:46.030
This will prepare you for vehicle localization and object-.
