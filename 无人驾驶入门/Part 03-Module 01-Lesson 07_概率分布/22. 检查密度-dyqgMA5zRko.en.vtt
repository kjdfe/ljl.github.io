00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:01.910
And, I hope you got this right as, of course,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.951
1 because the surface area has to add up to 1.

00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:06.435
This was to cross-check over here, whereby

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:13.160
1/18th times 12 is two-thirds and 1/36 times

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.493
12 is one-third, and two-thirds plus one-thirds

00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:20.428
equals 1. So, this was an example of a non-uniform

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:23.662
density that you were able to compute. As you

00:00:23.662 --> 00:00:26.762
can tell, each specific birth time has exactly a

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:30.762
probability of zero and this is just a density.
