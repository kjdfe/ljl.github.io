00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.221
Itâ€™s 0.002777 which is the same as 1 over

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:07.849
360. So, obviously, the probability for any

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.898
interval, defined by A and B, is the size of

00:00:10.898 --> 00:00:13.765
the interval divided by 360. And, if you

00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:17.000
got those right, you understand all this.
