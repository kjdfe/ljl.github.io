00:00:00.244 --> 00:00:02.693
Suppose, you look at the date and time you were

00:00:02.693 --> 00:00:06.626
born, and then specifically look not at the date

00:00:06.626 --> 00:00:10.291
, not even the time, but just the seconds of the

00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:13.199
time. So, it could be that we were born exactly

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.815
as the minute began, in which case, it was zero

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:20.593
; or exactly at second 59.282, I don’t know.

00:00:20.593 --> 00:00:22.353
Let’s assume it’s completely uniform. There

00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:25.035
is no preference to be born early in the

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:26.968
minute or late in the minute. I’m going to

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:29.692
ask you two questions now. For any such

00:00:29.692 --> 00:00:34.136
thing, X, where X is the seconds of the timestamp

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:37.294
, what’s the probability of that specific X

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:40.389
? And, what’s the density of that specific X?

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:43.110
It might mean that these are actually different questions.
