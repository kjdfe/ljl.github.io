00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:02.664
Okay, let’s make this interval really, really small.

00:00:02.664 --> 00:00:05.302
Let’s say we go from 179 degrees to 180

00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:08.644
degrees. So, it’s specific up to a single degree

00:00:08.644 --> 00:00:11.593
but is still an ever so slight range in the

00:00:11.593 --> 00:00:15.000
spectrum over here. What’s the probability?
