00:00:00.071 --> 00:00:01.627
This is the one I would pick and the reason,

00:00:01.627 --> 00:00:04.941
if it’s twice as likely to be born before noon,

00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:07.357
it means the density in the morning, before

00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:10.108
noon, should be twice as high as the density

00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:12.624
in the afternoon. And that’s best depicted by

00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:14.758
this diagram over here. This one would be

00:00:14.758 --> 00:00:17.206
uniform so ignoring the fact that it’s twice

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:18.977
as likely. And, this is even worse; it

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:22.000
emphasizes the afternoon over the morning.
