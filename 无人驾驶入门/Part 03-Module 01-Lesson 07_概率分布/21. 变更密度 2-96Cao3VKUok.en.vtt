00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:02.998
And, here’s how I calculate it. These spheres

00:00:02.998 --> 00:00:05.832
over here are all of the same volume. Since

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:08.399
they have to add up to 1, each of those has

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.246
exactly a third. Now, let’s start with the right

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:14.615
one. If this is a third in terms of area and we

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:18.846
have to cover 12 hours, then B equals to A

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:25.533
third times 12 which is 0.0277. The one on

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.391
the left is exactly twice the size, 0.0555

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:33.392
which is two-thirds times 12, it’s 1/18th.
