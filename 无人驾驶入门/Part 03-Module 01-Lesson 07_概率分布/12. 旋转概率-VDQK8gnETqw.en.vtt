00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.249
And the answer is zero. It’s zero for any other

00:00:02.249 --> 00:00:08.598
number. 179.99, 179.98 and so on, each

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:11.990
angle has probability zero. That’s because

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.575
getting that exact angle right with exact the

00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:18.575
right decibels, you just won’t be able to get there.
