00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:02.682
And, the correct answer here is 0. Any specific

00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:05.817
continuous thing, 0. For uniform distribution,

00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:07.903
we find that the interval weâ€™re talking about

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:11.034
skates between 0 and 60 so the correct

00:00:11.034 --> 00:00:15.034
answer is 1 over 60 and that is 0.01666.
