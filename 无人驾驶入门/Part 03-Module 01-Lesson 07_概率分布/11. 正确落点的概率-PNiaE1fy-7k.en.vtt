00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.979
So today I want to talk a little bit

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.380
more about probability distributions.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.000
And specifically talk about what's called

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.790
continuous distributions, because there's

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.530
some caveat that you should be aware of

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.250
as you go forward in this class. So

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.970
here is a new prop, it's a nerf gun, they

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.730
actually should like this, and we have

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.820
a lot of those of Udacity. I want to

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.310
know, to do an experiment in which shoot a

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.650
projectile and somewhere hits the ground,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.750
say between this location over here, and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.279
this location over here, I just don't know.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.309
So I call this A and B. The question I want

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.170
to raise is a tricky one,

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.840
consider any location X assume that the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.910
angle of the new kind of somewhat random

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.700
and source the pressure behind the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.260
projectile, what's the probability that

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.469
any specific XD might choose is the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.829
correct one.
