00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.400
So let's think of a really simple way we might solve this problem. And what I'm

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.939
going to suggest is a little like how we started. We're going to start on the

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.360
day of the first date, and we're going to just count the days, we're going to go

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.435
one day at a time. We're not going to do anything special when we go through

00:00:14.435 --> 00:00:18.120
months, we're just going to keep counting days, keep adding as we go. And we're

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.664
going to keep doing this until we get to our target date, and I got 156. So

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:26.450
here's our pseudocode for, a really simple, brain-dead way of doing it. We

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.770
initialize days to 0. We have a loop that keeps going as long as date1 is

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.589
before date2. And each step we advance date1 to the next day, and we add 1 to

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:36.903
the number of days.
