00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.506
So, now I want to make a key point here and we should have a smiley face. We

00:00:03.506 --> 00:00:07.114
haven't solved our problem but we're making progress. And making progress is

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:10.192
really good. We should be happy that we're making progress. And the way to make

00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:13.642
progress is not to write lots of code. It's to write small bits of code to test

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:17.214
them and to know what they do. We haven't solved the problem yet. We've got lots

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:21.076
of simplifications and we've only solved one part of it. But because of our

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:25.171
solution, well, once we implement nextDay correctly, we are a good part of the

00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:28.793
way there. So, let's keep that in mind and think about what we should do next.
