00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.043
So now we have the second step in our universal guide to solving all problems,

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:08.214
which is understanding what the outputs are. All we have left to do is the third

00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:11.614
step, and this is kind of the hard one. This is to solve the problem. So now,

00:00:11.614 --> 00:00:14.806
we're going to talk a lot more about how we actually do this. But I want to

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:17.658
emphasize that if you don't do the first part, you're going to have a really

00:00:17.658 --> 00:00:20.942
hard time solving the problem. So you always want to start by thinking about

00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:24.290
the inputs and outputs, and then go on to the hard part of figuring out how do

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.129
you map inputs to the correct outputs.
