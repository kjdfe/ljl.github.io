00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.225
So, you've spent a lot of sweat on this and you learned a lot word

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:07.050
Python and C++ and gotten us some very efficient software.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.132
I hope you like this,

00:00:09.132 --> 00:00:11.009
you like playing with software code,

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.404
and I hope you liked the introduction.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:15.209
Because if you do, you have a great future ahead of you,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.725
and you're going to be a great engineer going forward.

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:20.440
But now, for the next class,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.215
you're going to solve a really hard real problem.

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:27.940
You're going to build Google Maps, okay?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.490
You know Google Maps?

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.879
When you punch in an address and you hit the button shortest path,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.010
it routes you on the best path to get there.

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:39.390
You are going to build this and as you'll find out,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.750
all the tools you learned so far in Python will be super

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.000
useful in making this a real joy. So let's dive in.
