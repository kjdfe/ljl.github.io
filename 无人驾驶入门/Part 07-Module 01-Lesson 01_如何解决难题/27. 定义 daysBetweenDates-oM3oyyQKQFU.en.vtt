00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.727
So now, it's time to see if you can define a daysBetweenDates procedure that

00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:07.256
will produce the approximately correct results using the current nextDay

00:00:07.256 --> 00:00:11.108
procedure. If we add a correct nextDay procedure, your daysBetweenDates should

00:00:11.108 --> 00:00:14.936
produce exactly correct results. And I'm going to suggest one thing is a hint.

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:18.764
Doing daysBetweenDates by itself is still going to be more complicated than we

00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:22.256
want one procedure to be. So, I'm going to encourage you to start by defining a

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:25.819
helper procedure. And if you're following the problem solving strategy we've set

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:29.236
out so far, you should test the helper procedure independently before you try to

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:32.826
build the complete daysBetweenDates procedure. But I'm going to leave it up to

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:36.529
you to figure out what would be a useful helper procedure and how to do this.
