00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.318
So to answer this, let's think about the pseudocode we add before. We have this while loop,

00:00:04.318 --> 00:00:08.542
where we need to know as the stopping condition if date1 is before date2

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:12.766
and then we have the body that keeps incrementing the date. Well we've got

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:16.840
our procedure now to do this part. We implemented the nextDay, that we're ready

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.600
to turn into code. If we're going to write a helper procedure, we should write

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.380
something that makes it easier to do this date comparison. And that's going to

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.980
be a lot better to do as a helper procedure than to try to do that inside the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.570
daysBetweenDates code. Knowing whether a date's before another date is

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.389
something that is possibly useful, in other context we'll actually see another

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:39.079
use for it in writing this. The other advantage of writing that as a separate

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.694
helper procedure is we can test that separately. So instead of starting by

00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:46.204
writing daysBetweenDates right away, it would make a lot more sense to start by

00:00:46.204 --> 00:00:50.422
writing helper procedure that determines the stopping condition. So, let's do

00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:54.758
that. We're going to write a procedure dateIsBefore that takes as inputs, two dates,

00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:59.306
still encoded as three values. And it's going to return True or False,

00:00:59.306 --> 00:01:04.292
telling us whether year1, month1 and day1 is before year2, month2, and day2. If

00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:07.236
you weren't able to write the code for daysBetweenDates on your own, now that

00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:10.252
you've heard this hint, please try again. See if you can do it writing

00:01:10.252 --> 00:01:14.509
dateIsBefore first. And testing that that's correct before you go on to writing

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.469
the daysBetweenDates procedure. I'll show you my code next.
