00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.666
So now, we've got a simple mechanical solution and we've written out a pseudo

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.018
code. So now, we're ready to start coding but we should think carefully about

00:00:07.018 --> 00:00:10.390
how to do that. So now, the question is what should we do first? The choices

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.414
are, we should write the days between dates procedure that solves the whole

00:00:13.414 --> 00:00:17.388
problem. We should write a next day procedure that takes a current date given as

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:21.119
a year, month, and a day, and returns the next day. But only deal with simple

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.818
cases. Let's assume all months have the same number of days. We should write an

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:28.704
isLeapYyear procedure that takes a year and returns true or false, determining

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:32.414
if that year is a leap year. Or we should write a daysInMonth procedure that

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:35.886
takes a month and returns the number of days in that month. This is quite a

00:00:35.886 --> 00:00:39.055
subjective question. You could certainly make an argument for at least two of

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:42.081
these answers. But I want you to try and figure out which one is the best

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:42.473
answer.
