00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
The lesson you're about to watch is called,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:03.700
how to solve problems.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.985
And it's one of those lessons that I've seen several times

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:08.669
and every time I watch I get something new from it.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:12.089
It comes from one of Udacity's introductory computer science courses

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.890
and it's taught by Instructor named Dave Evans.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.410
And in this lesson he's going to lay out

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.149
a very systematic approach to solving hard problems in computer programming.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:22.349
I really love this lesson.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.000
I think you will too enjoy.
