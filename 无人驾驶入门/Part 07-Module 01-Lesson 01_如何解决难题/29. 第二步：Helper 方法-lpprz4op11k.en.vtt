00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.130
So here's my code for the dateIsBefore helper procedure. If year1 is before

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.414
year2 then we can return True right away. We don't care about the months and

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:11.600
the days if the years are different. If the years are equal then we need to look

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.376
at the months. If month1 is before month2, we return True. If the month's were

00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:19.027
the same, then we look at the days. And note that we don't have elses here. But

00:00:19.027 --> 00:00:22.803
if we don't hit the returns we're going to fall through to this last statement

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:26.980
and return False. And that could happen if either year1 is greater than year2,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.945
or the years are equal and month1 is greater than month2, or the months are

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:34.688
equal and day1 is greater than day2. In all of those cases, the first date is

00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:37.273
not in before the second date and we should return False.
