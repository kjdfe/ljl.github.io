00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.390
So that gives us some idea how to solve it systematically. If we thought about a

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.590
harder problem, let's say we increased the year, well then we would need to add

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.828
the days in the years, and some of those years will have 365 days. Some of those

00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:19.243
years will be leap years, and we'll have 366. So you see this is a fairly

00:00:19.243 --> 00:00:23.399
complicated problem. Maybe based on this we have enough of an idea to write down

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:26.752
as an algorithm what we did as a human. So that's what I'm going to try to do

00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:26.993
next.
