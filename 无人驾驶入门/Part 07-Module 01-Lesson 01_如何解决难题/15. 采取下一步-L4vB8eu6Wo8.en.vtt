00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.480
So now, we've done 3 main steps towards solving the problem. We understand the

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.206
inputs, we understand the outputs and we understand the relationship between the

00:00:08.206 --> 00:00:12.137
two based on some examples. At this point, you might be ready to start coding.

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:16.360
But if the problem is a challenging one, you're probably not. What I'll suggest

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.816
in the next step is that you should really think about how to solve the problem

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:22.808
as a human. If you don't understand how to solve the problem yourself in a

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:26.050
systematic way, you're probably not ready to start writing the code. So let's

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.601
think more carefully about how we actually compute this. So what I would

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:33.755
suggest to do next is to try working through a few cases in a very systematic

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:37.521
way as a human. And we're going to try a difficult case that covers many of the

00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:40.382
things that we would need to think about in an algorithm.
