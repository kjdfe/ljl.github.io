00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.795
So I think the best answer is the second choice, that we should make really sure

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:07.564
that we understand the problem before we progress on trying to solve it. I'll

00:00:07.564 --> 00:00:11.036
talk next on what it means to understand a problem and how to do that, but let

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:14.583
me go through the other answers before. It's often tempting to start writing

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:18.264
code too early. Writing code is fun and that's what we like to do as programmers

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:21.529
and computer scientists. The problem with starting to write code before we

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.430
understand a problem, is we might write the wrong code. We might get very

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.400
frustrated trying to write code before we really understand the problem or how

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.540
to solve it. Or we might end up writing a lot of code that doesn't actually

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.735
solve the problem we wanted to solve. The third choice is actually a very good

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:37.006
answer, if this weren't a practice problem. If it's a practice problem, you're

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:40.030
going to learn a lot more by trying to solve it yourself than finding an

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.124
existing answer. And then maybe understanding the answer, you'll still learn

00:00:43.124 --> 00:00:46.594
something. You'll learn a lot more by trying to solve things yourself. If it

00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:49.909
weren't a practice problem and you just wanted to solve this, and move onto the

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.269
next thing, searching to see if someone has already solved the problem. And for

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.519
a problem like this, probably there are good solutions out there already, is a

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.856
better use of your time than writing your own solution. Unless your goal is to

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:03.329
learn something by writing your own solution. The fourth place to start working

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.776
on an algorithm also depends on understanding the problem. Until we understand

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:09.399
the problem well, we don't know what algorithm we need to create.
