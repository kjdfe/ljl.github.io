00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.940
For most real world problems, it's up to you to figure out how to encode the

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.600
inputs and this is one of the most important decisions that you can make in

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.930
solving a problem. For the problems that we've used in CS 101, because they need

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.017
to be automatically graded and we want to run your code on test but we need to

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:20.376
specify carefully what the inputs are and how they're encoded. In this case, the

00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:24.102
template for the problem indicates how the inputs are represented, that there's

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:27.558
six parameters to the daysBetweenDates procedure, year one, month one, day

00:00:27.558 --> 00:00:31.014
one, and year two, month two, day two, and that means we're going to be passing

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:34.680
in six different values to represent those two dates. Those of you who've got a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.082
little further in the class will rise that there's better ways we might have

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:41.592
used to package the year, month and day into one object, but based on what we've

00:00:41.592 --> 00:00:45.450
seen only through unit two, passing them in as separate values makes sense. So

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.713
our solution needs to use inputs represented this way.
