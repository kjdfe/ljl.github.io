00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.585
So now, I've written my stub. And I'm going to modify daysInMonth to be

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:08.838
correct for all months except for February in leap years. So, to do that, we've

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:13.255
got to know how many days there are in a month, and I need Wikipedia for this.

00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:20.004
You may already know. Here we go. Here's the number of days in months. We have

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:26.997
31 days in January, March, and May, July, August, October, and December, so

00:00:26.997 --> 00:00:32.046
let's write our code. And I'm writing this using only things we've seen through

00:00:32.046 --> 00:00:36.704
unit 2. If I was writing this for real, I would do something a little bit easier

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:41.535
to type. And those are the 31 day months. An easier way to write this would be

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:45.223
to just list them all like this. That would mean the same thing but using a

00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:49.535
topple. We'll keep things only using things we've seen through unit 2. So, if

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:53.800
the month is one of those, we return 31. If the month is February, we're going

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.819
to return 28. And this is the case we're going to have to do something more

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:02.217
complicated if it's a leap year, and otherwise we're going to return 30. So, at

00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:06.633
this point, we should be able to add some tests, that should be correct now, if

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:11.102
we are not in a leap year, the day after February 28th is going to be March 1st.

00:01:11.102 --> 00:01:17.744
And a month that has 30 days, let's pick one, is September, it'll be October

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:21.126
1st. I think that's enough. The other test case, I think it would be good. That

00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:24.410
at this point, is something that looks at a whole year. If it's a non-leap year,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.035
we should correctly have 365 days. Okay, so now I've got some more test cases,

00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:33.382
and they should be correct, even for months that don't have 30 days, so let's

00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:38.495
try. See if I made any mistakes. And all the tests finished, so it sounds like

00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:39.333
they're correct.
