00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.049
Welcome to Project Zero.

00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:05.129
This is a quick project that gives you a chance to get your hands dirty,

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:08.064
writing code that controls a simulated car.

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:09.682
This project has three parts,

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:13.980
and in each part you'll write code to solve a particular driving situation.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.615
In the first part,

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:20.490
you'll write code that let's a car successfully jump over a small grove of trees.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.077
Now this isn't a common self-driving car problem,

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:24.710
but the real goal here is just to get you

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.120
used to the programming interface that you'll be working with.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.120
In part two, you'll write code that let's a car navigate a circular track.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.030
And in doing so, you'll be exploring

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.840
the relationship between steering angle and turning radius.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.205
We won't get into the math now,

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.019
but later we'll dig into this math more

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.455
deeply and refer back to this part of the project when we do.

00:00:43.454 --> 00:00:44.820
In the third part,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.969
you'll write a function which actually performs a sequence of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.659
steps to do something that a lot of human drivers really struggle to do,

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.000
parallel park a car.
