00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I want to make this a little bit more beautiful.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I will introduce a variable called "world,"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and for each of the 5 grid cells, world specifies the color of the cell--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
green, red, red, green, green.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Further, I define the measurement Z to be red.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Can you define a function, called "sense," which is the measurement update,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which takes as input the initial distribution p

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the measurement Z and all the other global variables

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and outputs a normalized distribution called "Q" in which Q reflects

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the non-normalized product of our input probability,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which will be 0.2 and so on,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the corresponding pHit or pMiss in accordance

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to whether these colors over here agree or disagree?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
When I call sense(p, Z), I expect to get the vector as output as before,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but now in the form of a function.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The reason I'd like to have a function here is because later on as we build our localizer

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we will apply this to every single measurement over and over again.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This function should really respond to any arbitrary p and arbitrary Z,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
either red or green, and give me the non-normalized Q,

00:01:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which gives me the vector 0.04 or 0.12 and so on and so on.
