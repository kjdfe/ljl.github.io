This is in principle our next belief.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It only has one problem, which is it isn't a valid probability distribution.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The reason why is probability distributions always have to add up to 1.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If I ask you what the sum of all these values,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
then we find out it doesn't add up to 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please type in the sum of all these values.
