00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I start with an empty list over here, 
and I build it up

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
using the append command over time.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I do so by iterating over all the elements
in my input probability p,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and I set a binary flag whether my 
measurement that I received is the same

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I would expect at the ith grid cell over
here from this list over there.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If the case hit is positive, it's true, 
so we're going to multiply p with pHit.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If it's false, then the flag hit will 
evaluate to zero, 1 - hit will be 1.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You're going to multiply p[i] with pMiss.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I build up the list, return it, and 
run it, and out comes

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.044
0.04, 0.12, 0.12, 0.04, and 0.04 as expected.
