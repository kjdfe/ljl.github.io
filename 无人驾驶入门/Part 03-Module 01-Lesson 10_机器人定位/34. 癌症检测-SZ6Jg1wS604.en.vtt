00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let me ask you Bayes Rule in the context of a completely different example

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to see if you understand how to apply Bayes Rule.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This time it's about cancer testing.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It is an example that is commonly studied in statistics classes.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Suppose there exists a certain type of cancer,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but the cancer is rare--only 1 in a 1000 people has the cancer--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
where as 999 in 1000 people don't have it,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
illustrated by the probability of cancer and the probability of not cancer.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Suppose we have a test, and the test can come out positive or negative.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The probability that the test triggers positive if you have cancer is 0.8,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and the probability that the test comes out positive given that I'm cancer free is only 0.1.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Clearly the test has a strong correlation to whether I have cancer.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here's a really difficult question.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Can you compute for me the probability of cancer given that I just received a positive test.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Let me emphasize this is not an easy question, but you should be able,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
based on what I've taught you, to calculate this result.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Think of the cancer/non cancer as the robot position

00:01:07.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and think of the positive as whether the colored door observed is the correct one.
