00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's just go back to our example and see what an amazing thing you've just programmed.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We had a uniform distribution over places.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Each place had a probability of 0.2.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then you wrote a piece of code that used the measurement to turn this prior

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
into a posterior, in which the probability of the 2 red cells was

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a factor of 3 larger than the posterior of the green cells.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You've done exactly what I gave you intuitively in the beginning as the secret of localization.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You manipulated a probability distribution over places into a new one

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
by incorporating the measurement.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In fact, let's go back to our code and test in your code whether we get a good result

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
when we replace our measurement red by green.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Please type green into your measurement variable and rerun your code

00:00:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to see if you get the correct result.
