00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is simple.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Use a for loop as shown here,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and you append to the list n elements, each of size of 1/n.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The dot over here is really important.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It gives you the floating point version.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Unfortunately, if we leave it out, the result will just be zeros,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which is not what you want.

00:00:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Now we are able to initialize the initial belief of the robot in the world over here.
