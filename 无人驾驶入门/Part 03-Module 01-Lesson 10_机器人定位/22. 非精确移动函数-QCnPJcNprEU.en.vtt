00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's one way to implement this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're going to introduce the auxiliary variable "s,"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which we build up in three different steps.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We multiply the p value as before for the exact set off by pExact.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Then we add to it two more multiplied by pOvershoot or pUndershoot

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
where we are overshooting by going yet 1 step further than U

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or undershooting by cutting it short by 1.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Then we add these things up and finally append the sum of those

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to our output probability q.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
When we run this, we get for our example prior of 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,

00:00:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the answer 0, 0.1, 0.8, 0.1, and 0.
