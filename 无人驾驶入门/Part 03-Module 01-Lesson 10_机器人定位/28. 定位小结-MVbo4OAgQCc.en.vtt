00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We learned that localization maintains a function over all

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
possible places where a road might be,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
where each cell has an associated probability value.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The measurement update function, or "sense," is nothing else but a product

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in which we take those probability values and multiply them up or down

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
depending on the exact measurement.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Because the product might violate the fact that probabilities add up to 1,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
there was a product followed by normalization.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Motion was a convolution.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This word itself might sound cryptic, but what it really means is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
for each possible location after the motion, we reverse engineered the situation

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and guessed where the world might have come from

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then collected, we added, the corresponding probabilities.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Something as simple as multiplication and addition solves all of localization

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and is the foundation for autonomous driving.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I want to spend a few minutes and go over the formal definition of localization.

00:01:03.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I'm going to introduce probability and ask you lots of questions.
