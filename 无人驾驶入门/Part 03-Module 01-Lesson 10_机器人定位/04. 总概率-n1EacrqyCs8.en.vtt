00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me begin my story in a world where our robot resides.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's assume the robot has no clue where it is.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then we would model this with a function--I'm going to draw into this diagram over here

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
where the vertical axis is the probability for any location in this world,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the horizontal axis corresponds to all the places in this 1-dimensional world.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The way I'm going to model the robot's current belief about where it might be,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it's confusion is by a uniform function that assigns equal weight

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to every possible place in this world.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That is the state of maximum confusion

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, to localize the world has to have some distinctive features.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's assume there are 3 different landmarks in the world.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There is a door over here, there's a door over here, and a 3rd one way back here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
For the sake of the argument,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
let's assume they all look alike, so they're not distinguishable,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but you can distinguish the door from the non-door area--from the wall.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now let's see how the robot can localize itself by assuming it senses,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and it senses that it's standing right next to a door.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So all it knows now is that it is located, likely, next to a door.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
How would this affect our belief?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Here is the critical step for localization.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If you understand this step, you understand localization.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The measurement of a door transforms our belief function,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
defined over possible locations, to a new function that looks pretty much like this.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
For the 3 locations adjacent to doors, we now have an increased belief of being there

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
whereas all the other locations have a decreased belief.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This is a probability distribution that assigns higher probability for being next to a door,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and it's called the posterior belief where the word "posterior" means it's after a measurement has been taken.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Now, the key aspect of this belief is that we still don't know where we are.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
There are 3 possible door locations, and in fact, it might be

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that the sensors were erroneous, and we accidentally saw a door where there's none.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So there is still a residual probability of being in these places over here,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but these three bumps together really express our current best belief of where we are.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This representation is absolutely core to probability and to mobile robot localization.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Now let's assume the robot moves.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Say it moves to the right by a certain distance.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Then we can shift the belief according to the motion.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And the way this might look like is about like this.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So this bump over here made it to here.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This guy went over here, and this guy over here.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Obviously, this robot knows its heading direction.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It's moving to the right in this example,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and it knows roughly how far it moved.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Now, robot motion is somewhat uncertain.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We can never be certain where the robot moved.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So these things are a little bit flatter than these guys over here.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The process of moving those beliefs to the right side is technically called a convolution.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Let's now assume the robot senses again, and for the sake of the argument,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
let's assume it sees itself right next to a door again,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
so the measurement is the same as before.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Now the most amazing thing happens.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We end up multiplying our belief, which is now prior to the second measurement,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
with a function that looks very much like this one over here,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which has a peak at each door and out comes a belief that looks like the following.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
There are a couple of minor bumps, but the only really big bump is this one over here.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
This one corresponds to this guy over there in the prior,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and it's the only place in this prior that really corresponds to the measurement of a door,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
whereas all the other places of doors have a low prior belief.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
As a result, this function is really interesting.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
It's a distribution that focuses most of its weight

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
onto the correct hypothesis of the robot being in the second door,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and it provides very little belief to places far away from doors.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
At this point, our robot has localized itself.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
If you understood this, you understand probability, and you understand localization.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So congratulations. You understand probability and localization.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
You might not know yet, but that's really a core aspect of understanding

00:04:30.000 --> 09:59:59.000
a whole bunch of things I'm going to teach you in the class today.
