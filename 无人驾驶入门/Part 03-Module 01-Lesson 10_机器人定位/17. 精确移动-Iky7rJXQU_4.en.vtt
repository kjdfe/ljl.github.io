00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is all of these are shifted to the right.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The 1/9 in the left-most cell goes over here, the 1/3 over here,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and finally the right-most 1/9 finds itself on the left side.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In the case of exact motion, we have a perfect robot.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We just shift the probabilities by the actual robot motion.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.635
Now, that's a degenerate case, but it's a good
one to program first so let's program this one
