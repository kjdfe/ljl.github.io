00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's our distribution again.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's our factor for getting the color right or for getting it wrong,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Write a piece of code that outputs p after multiplying in pHit and pMiss

00:00:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
at the corresponding places.
