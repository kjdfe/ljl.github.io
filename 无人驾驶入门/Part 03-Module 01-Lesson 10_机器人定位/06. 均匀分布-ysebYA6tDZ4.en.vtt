00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now in our Python interface, I'd like 
to take this code over here,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which assigns to p an empty list and 
modify it into code where p becomes

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:19.482
a uniform distribution over 5 grid cells as
expressed in a vector of 5 probabilities.
