00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
I started working at Udacity almost six years ago,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.390
and my first project was helping to make

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:08.589
a course called How to Program A Self-Driving Car.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.425
That course has since been renamed AI For Robotics,

00:00:11.425 --> 00:00:15.690
and the lesson you are about to watch is the first lesson from that course.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.714
Now I have had a lot of time in the last six years to learn

00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:22.234
way more about self-driving cars than is even covered in this course.

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:24.329
But I still find myself re-watching

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.959
these lessons and every time I do, I learn something new.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.064
At this point, I think I've seen the lesson you're about to watch maybe 10 times.

00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:35.324
So if you're a long time Udacity student,

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:39.385
you might recognize this lesson and a few others you encounter in this Nanodegree.

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:43.394
You are of course welcome to skip any lesson that you don't feel like re-watching,

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:48.285
but I suspect that if you do choose to re-watch you'll probably pick up something new.

00:00:48.284 --> 00:00:50.000
Either way, enjoy.
