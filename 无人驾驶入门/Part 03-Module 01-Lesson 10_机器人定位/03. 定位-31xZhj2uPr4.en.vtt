00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The very first problem I'm trying to solve is called localization.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.292
It involves a robot that's lost in space.

00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:10.277
It could be a car. It could be a mobile robot.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:15.000
So here is the environment, and the poor robot has no clue where it is.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.738
Similarly, we might have a car driving on a highway,

00:00:19.738 --> 00:00:22.492
and this car would like to know where it is.

00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:25.815
It is inside the lane or is it crossing lane markers?

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:29.169
Now the traditional way to solve this problem is by using satellites.

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.385
These satellites emit signals that the car can perceive.

00:00:33.385 --> 00:00:37.692
That's known as GPS, short for "global positioning system,"

00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:41.108
and it's what you have in your dashboard if you have a car with GPS

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.938
that shows you the maps and shows you where you are.

00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:49.000
Now unfortunately, the problem with GPS is its really not very accurate.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's really common for a car to believe to be here but it has

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.431
2 meters all the way up to 10 meters of error.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:59.262
So if you try to stay in the lane with 10 meters of error,

00:00:59.262 --> 00:01:04.792
you're far off, and you're driving right over here, and you crash.

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:10.000
So for our self-driving cars, to be able to stay in lanes using localization,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.231
we need something like 2-10 centimeters of error.

00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:17.631
Then we can drive with GPS in lanes.

00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:23.000
The question is, how can we know where were are with 10 cm accuracy?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.862
That's the localization question.

00:01:26.892 --> 00:01:31.985
In the Google self-driving car, localization plays a key role.

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:37.923
We record images of the road surface and then use the techniques

00:01:37.923 --> 00:01:42.062
I'm just about to teach you to find out exactly where the robot is.

00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:45.031
It does so within a few centimeters of accuracy,

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:50.385
and that makes it possible to stay inside the lane even if the lane markers are missing.

00:01:50.385 --> 00:01:54.969
So localization has a lot of math, but before I dive into mathematical detail,

00:01:54.985 --> 00:01:58.631
I want to give you an intuition for the basic principles.

00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:01.000
I want to tell you the story of how we will localize this,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.031
and then we can go through the math together so you can understand it.

00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:06.981
I also want to let you program your own localizer

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:18.000
so you can program a self-driving car.
