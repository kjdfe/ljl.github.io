00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I define a function "move" with an input 
distribution p and a motion number "U,"

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where U is the number of grid cells that the
robot is moving to the right or to the left

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I want you to program a function that 
returns the new distribution Q after the move

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
where if U equals zero, Q is the same as p.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If U equals 1, all the values are cyclically 
shifted to the right by 1.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If U equals 3, they are cyclically shifted to the right by 3.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If U equals -1, they're cyclically shifted to the left.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Please call the function with argument p 
and a shift to the right by 1.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I've commented out my measurement part 
because for now

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I don't want to do measurement updates.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In addition to this, I will use a very simple p,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that has a 1 at the second position and zeros elsewhere.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Otherwise, if we were to use the uniform p,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we couldn't even see the effect of the motion

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.934
whether that's programmed correctly or not.
