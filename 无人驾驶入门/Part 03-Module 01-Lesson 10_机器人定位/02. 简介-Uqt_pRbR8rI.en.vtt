00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So welcome to Artificial Intelligence for Robotics.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You are entering an exciting 7-week class

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in which you'll learn how to program self-driving cars.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And just to motivate what we're trying to achieve in this class,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
let me show you some videos.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
My interest in self-driving cars started with the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in which my team at Stanford developed Stanley,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
a robot that could drive itself through the Mojave Desert.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The vehicle was based on a Volkswagen Touareg

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that was equipped with all kinds of sensors like GPS and laser,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and it was able to make its own decisions without any human input whatsoever.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The DARPA Grand Challenge was a government-sponsored race

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that took place in 2005.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Here we see our robot Stanley moving through the desert

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
completely without a human on board.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The task was to drive a desert trail for about 130 miles,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and whoever was fastest would win the race.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Here we're passing a different robot by Carnegie Mellon University

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
about 110 miles into the race.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Our robot was able to navigate really steep mountainous roads

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and able to avoid collisions with rocks or falling down a cliff

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
all based on its ability to use what I'm going to teach you in this class.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
After almost 7 hours and 131 miles our robot returned all the way to the starting base

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
as the first robot to ever finish a DARPA Grand Challenge

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
winning Stanford University 2 million bucks

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and Stanley a place in the Smithsonian Museum of American History.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This work led to the Urban Challenge, in which we built another robot called Junior

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that eventually took second place.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The Urban Challenge was a followup race by DARPA

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
in which cars were asked to drive in traffic,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
so whereas the Grand Challenge was kind of a motionless desert floor,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
this was a mock urban city where the robot was able to interact with other traffic

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and had to follow the traffic rules as in this left turn over here.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It had to be stay on lanes with very high precision,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
accommodate oncoming traffic and just drive confidently

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in a situation that really resembled a small city.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This led at Google to a sequence of experiments

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
known as the Google self-driving car.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I believe these are the best robotic cars out there today.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Here we see one of our Priuses on University Avenue in Palo Alto

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.000
they are undetected, driving just like a human driver,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but this car was driving by itself.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Our cars have been able to drive hundreds of thousands of miles

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
all across California and some of Nevada,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in downtown areas like San Francisco, on busy highways.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Here in Monterey, a small coastal city in California with lots and lots of pedestrians.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
These are all completely self-driving moments where the car is able to accommodate

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
things like deer in the headlights in the middle of the night

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
or even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco as shown in this video.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
This is what I'm doing on my day job.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I really love, with my team, building self-driving cars.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
We believe it's going to really change the world,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and in this class that's what I hope to enable you to do.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.114
Let's dive in.
