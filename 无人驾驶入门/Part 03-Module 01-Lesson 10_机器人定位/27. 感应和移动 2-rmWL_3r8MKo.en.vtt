00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's run the program, and we find that the most likely cell is the 4th cell.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That makes sense, because the best match of red, red to the world

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is red over here and red over here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
After seeing the 2nd red, the robot still moved 1 to the right

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and finds itself in the 4th cell as shown over here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now I want to celebrate with you the code that you just wrote,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which is a piece of software that implements

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the essence of Google's self-driving car's localization approach.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
As I said in the beginning, it's absolutely crucial that the car knows

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
exactly where it is relative to the map of its road.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
While the road isn't painted green and red, the road has lane markers.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Instead of those green and red cells over here,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we plug in the color of the lane markings relative to the color of the pavement.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It isn't just one observation per time step, it's an entire field of observations,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
an entire camera image,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but you can do the same with a camera image

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
as long as you can correspond a camera image in your model

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
with a camera image in your measurements.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Then a piece of code not much more difficult than what you coded yourself

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
is responsible for localizing the Google self-driving car.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You just implemented a major, major function that makes Google's car drive itself.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I think you should be really happy and proud of yourself.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You should say to yourself, I just implemented localization.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now why on earth did it take Google that long to build a product that drives itself.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Well, the truth is the situation is a little more difficult.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Sometimes road get paved over and changed, and we're working on this.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But what you've implemented is the core of Google's self-driving car localization idea.

00:01:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let me just summarize the essential things we've learned.
