00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You might have guessed it correctly. 
It's the uniform distribution.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There's an intuitive reasoning behind this.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Every time we move, we lose information.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That is, in the initial distribution we know exactly where we are.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
One step in we have a 0.8 chance, but the 0.8 will fall to something smaller

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
as we move on--0.64 and so on.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The distribution of the absolute least information is the uniform distribution.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It has no preference whatsoever.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That is really the result of moving many, many times.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
There is a way to derive this mathematically,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and I can prove a property that's highly related, which is a balance property.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Say we take x4, and we'd like to understand how x4 at some time sub t

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
corresponds to the previous time distribution over all these variables.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
For this to be stationary, it has to be the same.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Put differently, the probability of x4 must be the same as 0.8p(x2) + 0.1p(x1) + 0.1p(x3).

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is exactly the same calculation we did before where we asked

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
what's the chance of being x4.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Well, you might be coming from x2, x1, or x3,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and there's these probabilities are 0.8, 0.1, and 0.1,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
they govern the likelihood you might have been coming from there.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Those together must hold true in the limit when things don't move anymore.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now, you might think there are many different ways to solve this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and the 0.2 is just one solution,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but it turns out 0.2 is the only solution.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If you plug in 0.2 over here and 0.2 over here and 0.2 over here,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
you get 1 x 0.2, and that's 0.2 on the right side.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Clearly, those 0.2s over here meet the balance that is necessary

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.821
to define a valid solution in the limit.
