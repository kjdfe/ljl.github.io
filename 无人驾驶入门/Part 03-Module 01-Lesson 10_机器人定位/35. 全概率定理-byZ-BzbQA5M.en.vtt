00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's look at motion, which will turn out to be something we will call total probability.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You remember that we cared about a grid cell "xi,"

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we asked what is the chance of being in xi after robot motion?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, to indicate the after and before, let me add a time index.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
T up here, is an index for time.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I write it superscript so there is no confusion with the index i, which is the grid cell.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You might remember the way we computed this

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
was by looking at all the grid cells the robot could have come from on time step earlier--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
indexed here by j.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We looked at the prior probability of those grid cells at time t - 1.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We multiply with the probability that our motion command would carry us from xj to xi.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This is written as a condition distribution as follows.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This was exactly what we implemented.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If there was our grid cells over here

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we asked one time step later about a specific grid cell over here,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we would combine 0.8 from over here, 0.1 from over here, and 0.1 from over here

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
into the probability of this grid cell.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's the same formula as here.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is now xi, and the way we find the posterior probability for xi is to go through

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
all possible places from which we could have come, all the different j's.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Look at the prior probabilities, multiply it by the probability that I transition from j to i

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
given my motion command, which in this case is go 1 to the right side.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now in probability terms, people often write it as follows:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
P(A) = Ʃ p(A│B) p(B).

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This is just the way you'd find it in text books,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and you can see directly the correspondence of A as a place i of time t

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and all the different Bs as the possible prior locations.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That is often called the Theorem of Total Probability.

00:01:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The operation of a weighted sum over other variables is often called a "convolution."
