00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:06.400
And the answer is 0.0079.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.049
In other words, there's only 0.79% chance,

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.217
0.79 out of 100 that, despite the positive test result,

00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:17.884
that you have cancer. And we're going to apply

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.934
the exact same mechanics as we did before.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:25.296
The result of Bayes Rule, non-normalized of C given POS

00:00:25.296 --> 00:00:32.257
is simply the product of my prior probability, 0.001 times 0.8,

00:00:32.257 --> 00:00:37.172
which is the probability of a positive result in the cancer state.

00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:41.058
And that ends up to be 0.0008.

00:00:41.058 --> 00:00:44.040
The non-normalized probability for the opposite event,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.758
the non-cancerous event, given a positive test,

00:00:46.758 --> 00:00:55.207
is 0.999 times 0.1. And that's obviously 0.0999.

00:00:55.207 --> 00:01:02.690
Our normalizer is the sum of both of those, which is 0.1007

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.040
just add these two values up over here.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.041
So dividing 0.0008, the non-normalized probability,

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:14.762
by 0.1007 gives us 0.0079.

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:18.573
We just applied Bayes Rule to compute a really involved

00:01:18.573 --> 09:59:59.000
probability of having cancer after seeing a test result.
