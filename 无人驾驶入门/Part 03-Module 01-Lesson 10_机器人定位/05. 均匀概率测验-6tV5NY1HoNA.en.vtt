00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's move into our first programming exercise,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and let's program together the very first version of robot localization.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here's a bit of program code--an empty list.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And what I'd like you to program is a world with 5 different cells or places

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
where each cell has the same probability that the robot might be in that cell.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So probabilities add up to 1.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Here's a simple quiz for the cells x1 all the way to x5.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What is the probability of any of those x's?

00:00:33.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Index i goes from 1 to 5.
