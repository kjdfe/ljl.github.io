00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
To turn this back into a probability distribution,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we will now divide each of these numbers by 0.36.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Put differently, we normalize.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Please, in these 5 fields enter your result for dividing 0.04 or 0.12 by 0.36.

00:00:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please check that the sum of those truly adds up to 1.
