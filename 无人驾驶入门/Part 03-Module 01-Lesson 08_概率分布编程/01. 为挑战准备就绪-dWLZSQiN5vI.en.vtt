00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.855
So, the next unit will be challenging,

00:00:02.855 --> 00:00:05.839
and we don't expect you to understand that first.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.275
You will probably struggle,

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.804
but we're going to now focus on programming

00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:13.945
probability distributions into computer code. Why is it important?

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:18.524
Because a lot of self-driving car code deals with uncertainty, with probabilities.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:23.104
And you have to understand how to program those in computer code.

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:25.605
If you get stuck, go to Slack,

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:27.750
talk to other people, you won't be the only one.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.210
And try to understand it, we are here to help you.
