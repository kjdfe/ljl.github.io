00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
So far, you've been writing code within the Udacity classroom,

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.067
in an environment that looks like this,

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:07.919
but you're also going to want to be able to

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.460
run your programs locally on your own computer.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.095
And this brings up another important difference between Python and C++.

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:18.772
You learned about the first major difference at the beginning of the last lesson.

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:23.489
And that's that Python is dynamically typed while C++ is statically typed,

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.904
which is why I have to write words like int.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:30.285
Another major difference is that Python is what's called an interpreted language,

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.494
whereas C++ is a compiled language.

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:36.629
The thing is when you write code in Python or C++,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.660
the computer can't understand directly what you've written.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.854
The code first needs to be translated into

00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:46.269
a language the computer understands in Python code,

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.493
there's a translator, also known as an interpreter,

00:00:49.493 --> 00:00:51.465
that goes line by line, first,

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:55.270
translating and then executing each line of code.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.750
Translate this line, execute it.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.579
Translate this line, execute it.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.170
This process of translate execute happens until you've reached the end of the file,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.500
or in this case, the end of the code cell.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.560
And running the cell, behaves as expected.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.960
The reality is a bit more complex than what I've described,

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:16.544
but this is the general gist of an interpreted language like Python.

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:19.885
With a compiled language like C++,

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:22.765
all of the code is translated into a language

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:26.224
the compiler can understand before any of it is executed.

00:01:26.224 --> 00:01:28.409
And this step is called compilation.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.409
Only after the program has been compiled,

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.825
can it later be executed or run.

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:37.469
And up until now, we've been hiding this compilation step from you.

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.847
When you've written code in the browser,

00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:41.355
and then scroll down,

00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:43.234
and pressed test run,

00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:48.400
we've been secretly compiling and then executing the code in the background.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.675
So the language has felt interpreted to you up until now.

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:55.216
But, when you write C++ code on your own computer,

00:01:55.216 --> 00:01:57.739
you're going to have to do the compilation step yourself.

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:00.049
And let me show you what that looks like on my computer.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.929
Here, I've got that same file,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.213
I call it demo.cpp.

00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:06.734
And if I actually want to run this code on my computer,

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:10.164
I have to first pull-up something called a terminal.

00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:13.079
And don't worry too much about what this terminal is for now.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.870
The only thing I want to show you is that when I type LS,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.332
which is a command to list all the files in my current directory,

00:02:20.332 --> 00:02:24.240
the only thing I see is this dem.cpp for now.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.070
So, now before I can run this code,

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.689
I need to first compile it.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.055
And for my computer,

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:33.580
I do that by typing g++ followed by the file name.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.650
In this case, demo.ccp.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.724
I hit enter, and nothing happens.

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:42.104
But, if I do another LS,

00:02:42.104 --> 00:02:45.846
I now see this second file called a.out.

00:02:45.847 --> 00:02:51.270
And this is a translated or compiled version of the code in demo.ccp.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.900
If I type./a.out, and hit enter,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.444
I get exactly the output I was hoping for.

00:02:57.444 --> 00:02:58.834
In the rest of this lesson,

00:02:58.835 --> 00:03:00.895
you're going to learn more about compilation,

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:04.000
and we'll start working with C++ code on your own computer.
