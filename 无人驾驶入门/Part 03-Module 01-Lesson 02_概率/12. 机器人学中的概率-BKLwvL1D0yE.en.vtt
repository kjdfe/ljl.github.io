00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
Hey, you're making great progress learning about probability

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.709
and you now understand how to design a coin flipping robot possibly.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.640
But, I just want to put in the void why you learn so much about

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.575
coin flipping when you really care about self-driving cars.

00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:19.219
Probability is the core of how a self-driving car runs.

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:23.564
And before diving into really complicated stuff like mapping and localization,

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.175
really want to tell the very basics because the basics

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.890
of finding out what the coin flip looks like

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.335
is exactly the same math as building

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:35.355
really great maps and localizing and controlling self-driving car.

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:38.204
So stay tuned, you're making great progress.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.469
And let's dive deeper.
