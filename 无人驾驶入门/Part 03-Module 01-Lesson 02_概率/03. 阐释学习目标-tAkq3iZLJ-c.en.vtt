00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
Your understanding of this word, uncertainty,

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:06.205
will continue to evolve and mature as you learn more about self-driving cars.

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:07.650
The next section is called,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.690
learning objectives for probability.

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:12.029
And these are sort of a snapshot of what your understanding

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:14.635
of this word should mean after this lesson.

00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:16.464
Because these learning objectives,

00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:18.390
they're really just a set of questions that you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.015
should be able to answer after this lesson.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:24.429
And in fact, we're going to show you these questions again later.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.780
We include them at the beginning of this lesson and other lessons in

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.490
the Nanodegree as a concrete way of demonstrating what it is you'll be learning.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.355
But you are not expected to be able to answer them yet.

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:38.789
If you can answer all these questions now,

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.450
then you should feel free to skip ahead to the next lesson.
