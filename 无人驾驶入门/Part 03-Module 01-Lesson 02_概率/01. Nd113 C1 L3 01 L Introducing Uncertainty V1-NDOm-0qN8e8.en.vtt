00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.080
Congratulations on submitting Project Zero.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.345
When I solved that last part of the project myself,

00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:09.254
it actually took me several tries to get the car to park,

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:12.070
and the process was largely trial and error.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.240
That's because I was uncertain of what effect a command

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.413
like car dot steer would have on vehicle behavior.

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:22.545
This is similar to something known as control noise in self-driving cars.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.260
And it turns out that uncertainty is

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.365
an unavoidable part of almost every component in a self-driving car.

00:00:29.364 --> 00:00:32.460
And managing this uncertainty is a huge part

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.840
of making a self-driving car that actually works.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.650
Now, this word uncertainty,

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.604
we mean something very specific when we use it in this Nanodegree.

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:42.894
To make sure we're talking about the same thing,

00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:47.380
I'd like you to think about how uncertainty shows up in a self-driving car.
