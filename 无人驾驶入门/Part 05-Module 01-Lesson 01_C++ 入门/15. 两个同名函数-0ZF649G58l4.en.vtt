00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; You said the header files they have function declarations.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:03.666
They can have a lot more.

00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:08.656
If you wanted to define a type that was the grid type,

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:11.370
instead of using this vector vector float.

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:12.899
Because you get kind of tired of saying that.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.625
&gt;&gt; I was writing that a lot, yeah.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:19.954
&gt;&gt; You can still do, type the death vector vector float grid.

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:23.250
Type T grid usually it's indicated as a type.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.509
And then you don't have to type it you can just do T grid everywhere.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.270
&gt;&gt; That would be nice.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.189
&gt;&gt; It would have been nice. Much less typing.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.609
&gt;&gt; It's good to know. Okay, thanks.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.490
&gt;&gt; You know, any time you find yourself really.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.237
&gt;&gt; Typing a lot.

00:00:34.237 --> 00:00:35.954
&gt;&gt; Typing the same thing over and over again,

00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:39.739
there's a good chance that somebody solved this problem for you.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.898
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:39.898 --> 00:00:41.790
&gt;&gt; Finding is not as easy,

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.570
but there's a good chance it exists.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.000
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, thank you.
