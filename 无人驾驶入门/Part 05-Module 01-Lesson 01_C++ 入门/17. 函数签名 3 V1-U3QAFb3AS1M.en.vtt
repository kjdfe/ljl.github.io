00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
&gt;&gt; So I guess the misconception I had was

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.820
that the unique identifier to the function was the name, close enough.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.400
But it's not, it's the signature.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.065
It's this whole, it's the return value,

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:13.649
the name, and all the inputs and their types.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.169
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.509
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's helpful.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.190
&gt;&gt; Good.
