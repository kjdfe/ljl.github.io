So welcome Elicia. Thank you so much for coming in today.

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:05.609
Hey, Andy. Thank you for inviting me.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.175
So I have been trying to learn C++.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.929
I'm not an expert myself.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.820
And the first thing I did when I was trying to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.519
learn this language was try to convert some of

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.344
that histogram filter code we had written in the first course of this nanodegree.

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:21.326
I tried to convert it from Python to C++,

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:23.859
and that was quite an experience. It was not easy.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.949
But I think that code might serve as

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.074
a good jumping off point for talking about what this language is.

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:31.439
Well, you let me look at some of it.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.620
So, I think, yes.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.909
We can talk more about it.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:37.319
Okay. So let's get into the details, the nitty-gritty of the code.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.000
But before we do that, do you want to just,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.554
high level, what is C++?

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:43.920
What's the difference between C++ and Python?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.929
Why do we need multiple programming languages?

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.234
There are some people who say you should learn lots of programming languages.

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:53.579
You should learn different languages because they have different uses.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.710
Python is fantastic for problem solving,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.250
for prototypes, for figuring out what the goal is and how to get there.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.060
But you don't necessarily care about what you're using to get there,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.034
whether you're using a moped or a nice car.

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:15.060
C++, on the other hand,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.150
knows what it's running on.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.540
It knows about processors.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.090
It knows about how it interacts with the world.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.471
And it's a very tactical language,

00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:28.799
where it has its feet in the computer its running on.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.109
It has lots of the Python features that help you implement solutions to your problem,

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.920
but it also has ways to do it really fast.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.719
And that is the real reason why C++ is important to this sort of development.
