00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.964
So in researching some C++ stuff,

00:00:02.964 --> 00:00:04.919
I kept seeing the term static

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:07.769
typing and language is being referred to as statically typed,

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:09.334
and C++ was one of those.

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:13.115
Can you explain what does it mean for a language to be statically typed?

00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:14.669
When you go to C++,

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.495
you're going to have to tell the compiler what kind of variable you want,

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:25.109
whether it's a floating point variable or whether it's a character or a string.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.530
You need to know ahead of time whether you want a lot

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.265
of precision like a float 64 or a double could give you.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:38.265
And you do this because it tells the compiler a lot about what it has to do.

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:40.710
In Python, you don't have to do that.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.799
You can have the variables be whatever they want,

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:46.919
and they can change halfway through. It doesn't matter.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.325
But if you declare a variable floats F in C++,

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:58.155
it has to be a floating point number for as long as F exists.

00:00:58.155 --> 00:00:59.490
Now, if you go to a different function,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.510
you can have an indefinite string F,

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:04.140
although that seems silly.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.840
It doesn't matter outside the scope of the name,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.503
but inside the scope,

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:11.265
it has to always be that type.

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:13.049
And so it is a fixed type.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.935
It's a static type, and that's what statically typed means.

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.420
So when designing a programming language,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.093
I'm making my own programming language,

00:01:20.093 --> 00:01:24.359
and I have a choice to go with a statically typed language or not.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.254
A dynamically typed language I think is the phrase.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.393
How do I make that trade off?

00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:30.240
What's going on in making that trade off?

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:32.519
Statically typed language is more

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:36.509
likely to be faster because you know ahead of time what you're doing.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.990
Dynamically typed language is likely to be more

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:44.030
flexible and to let the user decide later what it was they wanted to decide.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.430
So it's a flexibility versus speed trade off.
