00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.004
So I think I have some understanding of this,

00:00:02.004 --> 00:00:04.019
but if for example,

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.699
doubles are more precise than floats,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.759
why not just always use doubles?

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.240
Because they're bigger.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.285
It doesn't really matter if you're doing a small program,

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:19.035
but if you needed to do a program where you had a million variables,

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.882
doubles are twice the size of floats.

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:25.794
And our computers have so much memory now.

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:28.630
It's amazing what comes in our laptops.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.869
But when you go to an embedded system,

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.186
sometimes you don't have the memory,

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:35.729
and you need to be aware of your limitations,

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.414
of your resource constraints.

00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:40.439
So you choose to use floats or you even choose to do fixed point.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:45.000
But a self-driving car I can put a lot of computer into the trunk.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.269
Every computer you put into the trunk is a power waste,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.000
which means it's another mile you can't drive.
