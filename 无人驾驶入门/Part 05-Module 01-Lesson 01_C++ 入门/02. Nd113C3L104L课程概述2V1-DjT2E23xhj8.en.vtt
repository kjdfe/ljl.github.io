00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.129
Now that you're all set up, it's time to start writing some code.

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:04.710
But before we jump in, we should say

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.450
a couple things about how these lessons are formatted.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.660
Right. And the goal of this course is simple in some ways: translate Python code to C++.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.714
Now there's a good amount you'll need to learn in order to do that.

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:18.280
But most of it isn't very conceptually heavy.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.920
Yes, writing C++ will require you to know the syntax for a "for loop" for example,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.340
but you probably don't need a lecture on what a "for loop" is.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.019
Sure. So with this in mind,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.359
most of the instruction in the next lessons will

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.780
contain example code and text explanations.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.608
And when we do run into some unavoidable piece of something new in C++,

00:00:37.607 --> 00:00:39.359
like piling or declaring variables,

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.549
for example, part of the instruction will

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:44.454
draw on an interview I got to do with Elecia White,

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:47.539
who literally wrote the book on embedded systems.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:49.350
Yeah, why don't we show some of that interview.
