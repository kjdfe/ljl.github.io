00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.995
Now we're going to go to C++.

00:00:03.995 --> 00:00:07.259
C++ is the language of choice for

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.654
embedded systems like the stuff that runs on small processors inside a self-driving car.

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:17.054
Now in the beginning it'll be scary to see a complete different syntax,

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:20.160
a different language almost go from Chinese to Japanese is hard.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.800
But as you get more familiar with a different syntax,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.155
you find that the underlying tools are exactly the same,

00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:27.720
whether you do it in Python or in C++,

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.000
it's just at C++ runs faster.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.425
So in this unit,

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:34.109
we're going to turn you into a monkey, into a robot, okay?

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.689
So you're going to see things written in Python,

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:39.989
and we're going to ask you to translate it to C++ so that

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.310
you lose any fear of different syntax and become very,

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.060
very fluid in jumping back and forth between two different programming languages.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.457
And I promise you, at the end of the class,

00:00:49.457 --> 00:00:52.219
you'll find out they're basically the same, they're just written differently.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.564
But the underlying concepts are equivalent.

00:00:54.564 --> 00:00:58.000
And that's a great way to understand programming languages.
