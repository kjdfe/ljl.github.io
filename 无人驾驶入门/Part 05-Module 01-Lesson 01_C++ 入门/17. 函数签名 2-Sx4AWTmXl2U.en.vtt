00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
So with the Test-Normalized function we had

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.344
the return-type bold, the name Test-Normalized,

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:06.804
open and closed parenthesis,

00:00:06.804 --> 00:00:08.339
but I imagine this isn't

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.590
the total picture because this function didn't take any arguments.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.710
That's true. And if it was in a header file instead of that open curly brace you would

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.670
have a semicolon to say this is the function declaration instead of the definition.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.220
And if we wanted to take arguments it would be in those open parenthesis.

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.817
Take this other function, Normalize,

00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:35.670
where you have this kind of complicated signature,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.965
function signature, where have vector,

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:42.215
vector float and then normalize in vector vector float.

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:48.385
And what that says is that you want to return this vector vector,

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:53.030
so the grid of floats and you want to normalize,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.130
that's just your function name,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.460
and then inside you have another grid.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.730
When you switch it so that you are

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.039
not necessarily passing it the same way and copying it,

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.000
you'll find that you don't need all of those parameters.
