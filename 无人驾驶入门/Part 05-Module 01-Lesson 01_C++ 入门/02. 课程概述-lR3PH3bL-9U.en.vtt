00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.370
C++ is the language of self-driving cars.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.900
It's also a programming language that's a lot closer to what devices like

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.515
the NVIDIA PX2 understand than a higher level language like Python.

00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:13.785
So if you want to get a job in this field,

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:15.640
it's something you're going to have to learn.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.115
And while C++ is in most ways similar to languages like Python,

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:22.945
it also has several features which make it different.

00:00:22.945 --> 00:00:24.420
In this two nanodegree,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.500
you will learn C++ over two courses.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.589
In this course, we will focus on all the elements of

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.492
C++ that it shares with Python: variables,

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:33.989
loops, classes, and objects, etc.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.120
And in the next course, we'll focus on some of what makes C++ unique.

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:39.729
But the angle of this course,

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.339
is pretty straightforward, right?

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.975
Working C++ code.

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:45.060
In particular, you'll be asked to translate

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.545
the two dimensional histogram filter code that you wrote in Python into C++.

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:51.975
And when you get that to run correctly,

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:57.630
you'll have made a hugely important first step towards your eventual expertise in C++.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.900
Now before we continue, there are some basic housekeeping steps that you'll need to take

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.179
care of before you start writing and running C++ code on your computer.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.000
Follow the instructions we've outlined below before you move on.
