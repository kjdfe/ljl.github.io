Great job. You've reached the end of the lesson and you

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.695
don't have to memorize all the things you learned here and you can look them up.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:09.300
But it's good that you get an understanding of

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.495
how functions work and C++ and similar constructs.

00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:15.805
So pat yourself at the shoulder.

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:17.450
Okay. You got to this point.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.000
And then tomorrow Morning, let's forge on.
