00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.459
When you work on a self-driving car team,

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:04.980
at some point you will inevitably have to get in

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.025
the vehicle and actually observe its driving behavior.

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:10.620
And when the vehicle does anything unexpected,

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.029
you're probably going to have to file a ticket.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.464
And in reality, this is something you'd be doing on a computer.

00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:17.820
But the analog version of

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.870
a ticket tracking system is something that's useful to think about for now.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.550
So, in this analog version,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.195
a ticket is a physical thing.

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:28.829
And as you can see, the ticket has fields.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.094
In this case, it has a place for the date,

00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:33.710
the priority, and a description.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.505
And once you filled out the ticket,

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:39.554
you'll have to file it away maybe in some box of outstanding tickets.

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:42.479
And likely, this box is sorted by date with

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.059
the oldest tickets in the back and the newest in the front.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.344
So, you could just put the new ticket right in the front of the box.

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:51.615
Now, it's important to know,

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:54.329
that this choice to store tickets in a single box,

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.184
ordered by date, is a design decision.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:01.895
And somebody made that design decision when planning this ticket tracking system.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:05.579
But it's not the only way it could have been designed.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.620
So, now, I'd like you to think about

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.000
this particular design and some of the tradeoffs that it made.
