00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.743
Up to this point and then I agree,

00:00:01.743 --> 00:00:03.924
you've been using Python lists.

00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:07.343
You've represented one and two dimensional worlds both with lists.

00:00:07.344 --> 00:00:09.846
matrices and vectors as lists.

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:15.128
And later in the stand agreed you'll see how even an image can be represented as a list.

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:16.486
And lists are great,

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:20.410
especially when the data they contain is ordered in some meaningful way.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.644
But the list isn't the only data structure that you have to work with.

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:25.041
And in this lesson,

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:29.565
you're going to learn about two additional data structures called dictionaries and sets.

00:00:29.565 --> 00:00:31.710
And learning to use these data structures

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.755
correctly will allow you to write code that's easier to read,

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:38.225
faster to write, and more efficient to run.

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:40.289
And these data structures also tend to show

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.269
up on programming interviews pretty frequently.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.910
So knowing a bit more about them is never a bad idea.

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.004
But, before we jump into these new data structures,

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:54.000
let's get a sense for what it even means to talk about the structure of data.
