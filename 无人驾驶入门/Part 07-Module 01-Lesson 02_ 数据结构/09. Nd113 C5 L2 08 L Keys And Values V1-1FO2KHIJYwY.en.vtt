00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
You just saw how a dictionary can improve

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:05.580
code readability and help us avoid making mistakes,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.250
by allowing us to access data through a key,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.339
like date or priority.

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:12.669
This key is associated with a value,

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.580
so tickets description key,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.109
maybe associated with the value vehicle unexpectedly stopped at green light.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.869
But sometimes we don't actually want to associate the key with any value.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.460
Sometimes, the key itself is enough.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.589
Like, if we want to add tags or labels to a ticket.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.949
Let me show you how you Udacity actually handles

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.280
tickets with ticket tracking software called Jira.
