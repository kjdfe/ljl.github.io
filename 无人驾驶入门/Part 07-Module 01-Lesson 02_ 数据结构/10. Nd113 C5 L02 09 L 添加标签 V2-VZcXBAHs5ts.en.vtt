00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.894
So this is JIRA's create issue dialog box

00:00:03.894 --> 00:00:05.610
and the word Issue they're using just

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.165
like we've been using the word Ticket, just so you know.

00:00:08.164 --> 00:00:11.384
And as you can see in Issue has an associated Project,

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:13.140
an Issue Type, in this case,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.740
we're going to call it a bug, and a Summary.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.975
In this case, literally everything is broken maybe.

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:22.141
So, this is a pretty bad bug.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.304
I'm going to ignore some of these fields here.

00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:29.414
But, I'm going to give it a priority of highest and let's have some labels to it.

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:31.424
Maybe you think the issue in the Python code,

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:34.920
so I'll type p_y_t and I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.609
can see up here that an autocomplete is suggesting Python as a label so,

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:44.890
I can click that, and maybe also I want to give it the label of bug, also a suggestion.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.980
Now, let's see what happens if I'm not thinking and I tried to add Python again.

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:51.909
No matches.

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.829
Somehow, JIRA is ensuring that this data structure,

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.295
not have duplicates of the same label.

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:02.160
Now, there's a data structure in Python that does exactly this,

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.655
called the Set and that's what I want to teach you about next.

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:07.765
But, before we do that, let's create our Issue,

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:11.189
and let's click on this Python label.

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.384
And as you can see, this is something that JIRA supports.

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:16.844
It's showing me everything, with a label of Python,

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:20.655
and it showing me every Issue that has that associated label.

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:23.189
In the next notebook, you're going to implement

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.269
similar functionality to the ticket tracker we've been working with,

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:30.030
and in doing so, you're going to learn about a new Python data type called
