00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
The ticketing system we discussed before,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.560
made it really easy to find the oldest ticket.

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:09.224
All we had to do was pull out whatever ticket was in the back of the box.

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:11.814
And this is a good feature of the system.

00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:14.339
It's totally possible that whoever handles these tickets

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.964
will want to address them in chronological order,

00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:20.339
to make sure that the oldest issues get resolved first.

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.100
But, what if we want to handle the most important issues first?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.510
The system doesn't give us any good way to do that.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.310
So, hopefully spend some time thinking about how you might design such a system.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:32.655
When I thought about that question,

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:33.990
I came up with three ideas,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.700
I considered the pros and cons,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.260
and eventually, I settled on the one that I thought was best.

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:41.684
Now, I'd like to walk you through my thought process,

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:45.915
because the sort of thinking we do when we think about designing ticketing system,

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:48.420
is almost exactly the same as the thinking we

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.000
do when we choose data structures when we're programming.
