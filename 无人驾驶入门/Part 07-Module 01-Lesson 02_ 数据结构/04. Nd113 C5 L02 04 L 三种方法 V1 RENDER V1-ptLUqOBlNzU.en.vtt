00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
For my first attempt, I took the problem at face value and thought,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.130
what if all I cared about was a tickets priority level and nothing else.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.770
And in that case, I could just have three bags.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.959
And after filling out each ticket,

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.560
I would just toss it in the appropriate bag.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.820
Whether it's high, low, or medium priority.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.975
And this really isn't a terrible solution.

00:00:22.975 --> 00:00:25.740
In fact, it's a great solution if the tickets priority

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.119
really is the only structure in the data that we care about.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.080
But, it's probably not.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.449
We probably do care about when a ticket was filed as well.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.390
And that thinking, I made option two,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.225
which is to sort by priority on insert.

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:43.325
And in this option we go back to having a box.

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:45.929
But now the goal is to make sure that these tickets stay

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.255
sorted first by priority, and then by date.

00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:51.315
So all the high priority tickets,

00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:52.598
would be in the back.

00:00:52.598 --> 00:00:54.209
All the tickets in the middle,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.675
would be medium priority,

00:00:55.674 --> 00:00:58.794
and all the tickets at the front would be low priority.

00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:01.715
Now, let's think about how I would have to use this system.

00:01:01.715 --> 00:01:05.745
In this system when I go to file a high priority ticket for example,

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:08.400
I'm first going to have to find where it belongs.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.180
So, in this example, I would need to search through all of these tickets that

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.740
are already in the box until I find the first high priority ticket,

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:18.329
and that's where I would have to put this one,

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.974
right in front of the first type priority ticket.

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:23.519
And initially I did really like the solution,

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:27.075
but this extra time required to file a ticket started bothering me.

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:30.990
When I'm in the vehicle, I should be focused on the vehicle not on filing my tickets.

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:32.274
So when I do file tickets,

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.890
that process really ought to be as fast as possible.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.010
And this led me to the third option and the one I ended up taking,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.655
which is to have multiple boxes.

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:44.519
And in this option I just replaced my one box of tickets with three.

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:47.849
One for each of the priorities. So here I have a low priority box,

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:49.364
a medium priority box,

00:01:49.364 --> 00:01:51.164
and a high priority box.

00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:53.010
And just to keep everything tidy,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.625
I keep all three of these in a little box itself.

00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:58.650
And then now, when I want to file a ticket,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.094
I just put it at the front of the appropriate box.

00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:04.000
No rifling through all tickets required.
