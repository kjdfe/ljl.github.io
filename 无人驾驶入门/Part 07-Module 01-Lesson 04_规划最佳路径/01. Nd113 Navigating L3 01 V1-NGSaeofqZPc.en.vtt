00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.345
So, I hope you had fun listening to my good friend,

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:06.849
and colleague Peter Norvig, explaining A-star,

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:11.960
and I with him developed at Stanford many decades ago by Peter Hart business,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.305
and others good friends of mine and colleagues of mine.

00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:19.664
Now, the challenge, should you choose to accept it,

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:22.329
is to turn this into a computer code.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.719
So, you hopefully understood the algorithm,

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:28.054
but you haven't given your word about how to code it.

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:29.940
If you manage to code it,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.100
I will be officially proud of you.
