00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
Now we're going to take another step towards calculus.

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:05.009
So far, you've seen how he can look at

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.369
one journey at different resolutions or time intervals.

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.639
In the early example we first used a one-hour time interval,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.720
and then 20 minutes and then so.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.285
And everytime we decreased the time interval we got closer to the full story.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.870
And you've also seen how you can use these measurements of

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.350
position and time to calculate average speed.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.880
But if you think about it that's a pretty weird way to figure out your speed in a car.

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:30.440
If you want and how fast you're going,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.234
you can always just look at a speedometer because a speedometer measures speed directly,

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:39.840
and the speed that a speedometer shows is your instantaneous speed.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.545
It's how fast you're going at the instant that you look at the dashboard,

00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:46.230
and speedometers are very useful but for

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.229
the purposes of this lesson and learning something about calculus,

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.859
the question on what you to think about and explore the next notebook is this.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.244
We know that it's possible to measure instantaneous speed with a speedometer,

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:59.414
but is it possible to calculate

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:03.839
instantaneous speed using the position and time measurements we've been discussing?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.745
If it is, then how?

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:11.090
And if not, what can we do to approximate instantaneous speed as closely as possible?
