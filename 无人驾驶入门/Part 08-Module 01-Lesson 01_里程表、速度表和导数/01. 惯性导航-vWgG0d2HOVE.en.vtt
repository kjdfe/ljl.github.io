00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Welcome back students.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.910
It's great to see you again.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.800
Today, we're going to talk about odometry.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:13.109
Odometry sounds crazy, is the robot's ability to integrate internal measurements,

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.496
like it's wheel rotation,

00:00:16.496 --> 00:00:18.789
other stuff, to figure out how far it's gone.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.500
Before we do this,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.519
I want to make a human odometry experiment with you.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.780
Okay, so next quiz, get up your feet.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.929
Close your eyes.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.640
Walk forward five steps.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.024
Turn around 180 degrees and walk forward five steps again.

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:41.939
Open your eyes. Did you manage to get to the same spot?

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.649
Well, while you were doing this,

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.129
your own brain performed odometry,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.270
integrate the motion from your muscles and your senses,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.195
and figure out where you are.

00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:56.619
And just like me, you're not perfect.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.109
You're probably a little bit off. You're not really perfect.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.409
Robots aren't perfect either,

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:06.799
but robots constantly take sensor data from inside and calculate how far they've gone.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.049
Now, robots are a little bit different.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.478
They use the rotation of their wheels,

00:01:11.478 --> 00:01:13.826
they use inertial measurements.

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:15.429
Inertial measurements are magnetometers,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.025
and gyroscopes, and accelerometers.

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:23.705
And putting this data together into a coherent belief of how far we've

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:28.000
gone is what this next lesson will be all about.
