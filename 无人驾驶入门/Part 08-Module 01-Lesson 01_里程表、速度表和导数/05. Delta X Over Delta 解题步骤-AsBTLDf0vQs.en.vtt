00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.089
Hopefully, this was a pretty straightforward calculation,

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:07.264
but I still want to go over the solution so I can introduce some terms that might be new.

00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:09.369
First, let's just go through the steps.

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.369
The problem is to calculate the average velocity between 2:00 and 3:00.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.809
Well, average velocity is just distance traveled divided by time elapsed,

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:20.772
or in more mathematical terms,

00:00:20.772 --> 00:00:24.734
distance traveled is given by delta X or change in position,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:28.769
and time elapsed is given by delta T or change in time.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.844
This triangular character is the upper case,

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:35.174
Greek letter delta, and it usually means change.

00:00:35.174 --> 00:00:38.114
When you see something like delta next to an X,

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:41.130
you should not think of that as delta times X.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.850
Instead, you should just think of it as one variable called delta X.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.465
And the way you calculate delta X is like this,

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.060
final position minus initial position,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.484
likewise, for change in time.

00:00:53.484 --> 00:01:00.945
And in this example, that would be 80 minus 30 divided by 3 minus 2 or 50 over 1,

00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:03.289
which is just 50 miles an hour.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.560
And this should all make sense.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.350
If I want to know my average speed between 2:00 and 3:00,

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.826
I need to know how far I moved in that time,

00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:12.894
delta X, and I need to know how much time actually elapsed,

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:17.280
delta T. Now, there are a few points I'd like to make about this calculation.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.125
First, I want to highlight that what we calculated here was the average velocity,

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:23.909
and this is not what you measure when you look at your speedometer.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.799
We'll explore this more in a bit.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.765
Next, I just want to introduce this term, displacement.

00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:33.180
I'll be using this term interchangeably with distance traveled or delta X.
