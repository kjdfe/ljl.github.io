00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Data often tells a story.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.675
And often, a good plot can really help reveal what that story is.

00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:09.109
Now I'd like to show you how I think about these position

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:13.144
versus time graphs to figure out the story the data tells.

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:14.939
Here, we have two axes.

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:20.625
In this case, time is the horizontal X axis and position is the vertical Y axis.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.129
And to begin, let's start with the simplest version

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.603
of our story by adding two data points,

00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:28.769
one for a starting position of 30 miles at 2:00,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.039
and one for ending position of 80 miles at 3:00.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:33.659
Now, whenever I see data like this,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:39.109
it's often helpful to imagine or even actually plot a line that connects the points,

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.394
and this line represents where the car would have been at every moment between 2:00

00:00:43.395 --> 00:00:48.185
and 3:00 if it were traveling at a single constant speed the whole time.

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:51.900
The line like this can be pretty helpful in making sense of these plots.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.414
Because once I have the line,

00:00:53.414 --> 00:00:55.409
it's easier to see the change in position,

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.028
or delta X, which is just the vertical separation between the two points.

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:02.670
And change in time, or delta T,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.614
which is just the horizontal separation of these points.

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:06.689
And as you saw earlier,

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.105
you can also calculate average speed by dividing delta X by delta T. Now,

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:16.170
I want to point something out that has some pretty profound implications for calculus.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.600
The calculation of V average is

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.479
the same calculation you would make to find the slope of this line.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.620
If you remember back to algebra,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.207
slope is calculated as the vertical change in the graph divided by the horizontal change.

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:34.264
Or as I learned it, slope equals rise over run, which in this case,

00:01:34.265 --> 00:01:36.519
is delta X divided by delta T,

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:38.659
so you can see that the slope of this line gives us

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.909
the average speed between these two points.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.215
And when the slope is steeper,

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:44.960
it means the average speed is faster.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.509
Now, we have to be careful to remember that this line is really just something we drew.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.219
It does not necessarily reflect where the car really was during the whole trip.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.239
If we want to know a more complete story,

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:57.984
we're going to need more data.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:02.375
So, let's say we had sampled at 20-minute intervals and found that at 2:20,

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:06.194
the odometer read 40, and at 2: 40, it read 70.

00:02:06.194 --> 00:02:09.334
Well, once again, I'm going to draw some lines to connect these dots.

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:12.379
And now, remembering that the slope of the line between

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.469
any two points gives the average speed between those points,

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.544
I immediately can see that here in the first 20 minutes,

00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:21.709
the car was on average going much slower than it

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.530
was in the next 20 minutes since the slope isn't nearly as steep.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.140
Then, in the last 20 minutes,

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.669
the car, on average,

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.549
was moving slow again,

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.630
and this really helps make the story clearer.

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.849
And if I want an even better understanding,

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.585
I would need even more data sample with an even shorter time interval,

00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:42.335
like every 10 minutes or 5 minutes.

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:43.520
And with this much data,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.965
we don't even really need the connecting lines as a visual cue.

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:49.580
And now, I can see that the average speed appears

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.540
to have been greatest between 2:30 and 2:35,

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.179
and they know that because I can see that the slope is steepest here,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.314
which just means that delta X over delta T is greatest here.

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:04.000
And now, I like to give you a chance to interpret some graphs on your own.
