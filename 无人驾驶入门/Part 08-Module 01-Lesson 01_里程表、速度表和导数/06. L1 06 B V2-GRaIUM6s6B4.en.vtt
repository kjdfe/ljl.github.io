00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.214
Previously, I told you the mileage at 2 o'clock and then again at 3 o'clock,

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:08.054
and you could calculate my average speed as 50 miles per hour.

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:13.035
So in that example, we could say I made two measurements of my position or displacement,

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:15.884
with a time interval of one hour between them.

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:19.079
Now something we'll explore in the rest of this lesson,

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.359
and the next is what happens when we make

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.030
that time interval smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.280
So let's think, what happens when we make position measurements more and more frequently.
