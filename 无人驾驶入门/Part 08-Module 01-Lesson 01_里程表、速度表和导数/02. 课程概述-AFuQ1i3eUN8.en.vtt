00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.754
Welcome to vehicle motion and control.

00:00:02.754 --> 00:00:04.410
Imagine you're riding as a passenger in

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.605
a car with your eyes closed and your ears plugged.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:10.275
What would you be able to know about your motion?

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:12.835
You could probably tell when the car accelerated quickly,

00:00:12.835 --> 00:00:14.505
or came to a sudden stop,

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:16.245
or if it made a sharp turn.

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.570
But what are the limits of this knowledge?

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.839
Could you reconstruct your entire path for a drive?

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.370
If so, how?

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.990
This course is a crash course,

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.250
no pun intended in vehicle motion.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.452
And in this course,

00:00:28.452 --> 00:00:30.794
you're going to explore exactly this question.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:35.490
As you do, you'll also learn the very basics of calculus and trigonometry,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.109
two branches of math which are used extensively in self-driving cars.
