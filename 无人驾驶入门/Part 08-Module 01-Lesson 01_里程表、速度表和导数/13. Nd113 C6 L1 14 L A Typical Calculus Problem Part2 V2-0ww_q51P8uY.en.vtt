00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
In this typical problem,

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:05.880
the vehicles position is given to you in terms of this nice algebraic expression,

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.330
and the corresponding graph.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.695
And when you know the algebraic description of a function, like position,

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:16.045
then there are all sorts of clever things you can do to calculate the derivative exactly.

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:18.655
And by exact, I mean you can actually find

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:22.914
another algebraic equation that gives you the derivative at any point.

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:27.887
So for this function, the derivative winds up being -2T + 10,

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:30.250
and that looks like this as a graph.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.320
And it's actually pretty amazing that it's possible to get an algebraic description of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.520
something like velocity from an algebraic description of position.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.770
But the problem is that in reality,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.435
when you're dealing with a real car,

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:44.145
navigating in the real world,

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:47.400
you are never given this kind of description of motion.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.920
Nobody ever tells a self driving car, hey,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.745
your position for the next 10 seconds will be described by the following equation.

00:00:53.744 --> 00:00:57.164
In reality, what you're going to get is data,

00:00:57.164 --> 00:01:00.780
and that data will come from your accelerometers, your odometers,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.609
your cameras, and LIDARs and radars,

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.000
and it won't necessarily be pretty.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.614
In the rest of the lesson,

00:01:06.614 --> 00:01:08.084
you'll do exactly this,

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:10.109
you're going to work with odometer data to

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.000
implement a speedometer and then an accelerometer.
