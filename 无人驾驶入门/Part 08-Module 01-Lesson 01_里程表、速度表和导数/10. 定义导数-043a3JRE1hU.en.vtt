00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
So far, we've been talking a lot about velocity and position.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.200
And the reason for that is because these two quantities are

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.115
related to each other in three important ways.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:16.304
First, velocity is the instantaneous rate of change of position.

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:19.464
Now, we tried to approximate the instantaneous rate of change in

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:23.309
the previous examples when we made delta T smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:26.834
And we saw that as delta T got closer and closer to zero,

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:30.940
our estimate of the true instantaneous speed got better and better.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.335
Another important relationship between velocity and position is this,

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:38.170
velocity is the slope of the tangent line of position.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.780
And what this means is that if we have

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.505
a single continuous graph of position versus time, like this,

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:49.545
and we want to know the velocity at some point like, let's say here,

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:52.500
then what we do is we first draw what's called

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.299
a tangent line which is the line that just grazes the graph at this point.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.919
So in this case, the following would not be a tangent line,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.439
even though it passes through the orange point it doesn't graze the graph,

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.924
it slices right through it.

00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:09.807
The tangent line to the point would look more like this,

00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:13.195
since this line just grazes the graph at the orange point.

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:16.784
And this makes statement number two a pretty amazing fact.

00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:19.679
When you have a graph of position versus time and you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.590
want to know the instantaneous velocity at any moment,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.814
you can just find the tangent line to the graph at that moment and calculate its slope.

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:29.310
Now, the third relationship,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.159
which is really just another way of saying these first two,

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.247
is this: velocity is the derivative of position.

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:43.109
And in calculus, the derivative is defined as the instantaneous rate of change.

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:44.760
It tells you how one variable,

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.585
like position, changes with respect to another, like time.

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:51.059
And derivatives tend to show up in situations where we

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.644
care about how various quantities change together.

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:58.334
So, for example, how much will my wheels turn when I turn my steering wheel one degree?

00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:01.394
Or, how much will my acceleration increase?

00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:04.589
Or how my localization uncertainty change

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.025
when I increase my sensor update frequency by 10 percent?

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:11.069
In order to answer any of these questions mathematically,

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.689
you'll need to use derivatives.

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.590
And if these questions or these three statements don't quite make sense yet,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.000
don't worry, we're going to keep exploring derivatives for the rest of this lesson.
