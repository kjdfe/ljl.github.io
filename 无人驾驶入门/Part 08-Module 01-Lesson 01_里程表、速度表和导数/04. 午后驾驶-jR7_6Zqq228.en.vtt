00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
I love driving, but sometimes I get a little bored.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.820
On my last road trip,

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.605
I decided I wanted to keep track of some data about my drive.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:09.910
So, I reset my trip odometer to

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.859
zero at the very beginning of my trip and started driving.

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.355
At exactly 2:00 pm,

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:17.664
I noticed that my trip odometer had just hit 30 miles.

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:19.890
And later, at exactly 3:00,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.054
I looked again and noted that the odometer had just hit 80.

00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:28.039
Can you tell me, what was my average speed of between two and three o'clock?
