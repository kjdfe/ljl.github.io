00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.909
Now I'm going to challenge you.

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:03.209
You just learned about

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:07.195
one dimensional histogram filters and now you're going to build your own.

00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:10.865
And to challenge you is going to be a two dimensional histogram filter.

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:15.109
So get your hands dirty and help us build a localization for

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.000
what looks pretty much like a almost realistic self-driving car.
