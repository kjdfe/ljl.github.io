00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's do this again.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Suppose our mean is 10 and 13, and the variances are imbalanced--8 and 2--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which corresponds to the following picture.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
There's a relatively shallow distribution centered on 10

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and a much more peaked distribution centered on 13.

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Compute for me what the resulting mu prime and sigma-squared prime are.
