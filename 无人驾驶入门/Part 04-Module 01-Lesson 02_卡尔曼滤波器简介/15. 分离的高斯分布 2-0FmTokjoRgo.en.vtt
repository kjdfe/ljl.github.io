00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me ask the hard question now.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Will it be a Gaussian like this where the variance is larger,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a Guassian with the exact same variance,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
or an even more peaked Guassian that's more certain

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
than the two original factors in this calculation.

00:00:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please check exactly one of the three boxes over here.
