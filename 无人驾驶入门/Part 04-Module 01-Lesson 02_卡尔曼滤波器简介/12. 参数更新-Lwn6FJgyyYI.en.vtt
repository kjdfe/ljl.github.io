00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer for the new mean is just the one in the middle,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and reason is both weights over here are equivalent,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so we take the mean between mu and nu, which is 11.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Then sigma-squared is 2.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If you take 1/4 plus 1/4, then you get 1/2, so 1 over 1/2 equals 2,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.383
which means the new variance term is half the size of the previous variance terms
