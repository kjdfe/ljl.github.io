00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You remember our Markov model where the world was divided into discrete grids,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and we assigned to each grid a certain probability.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Such a representation of probability over spaces is called a histogram

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in that it divides the continuous space into a finite many grid cells

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and approximates the posterior distribution by a histogram over the original distribution.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The histogram is a mere approximation for this continuous distribution.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In Kalman filters the distribution is given by what's called a Gaussian.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
A Gaussian is a continuous function over the space of locations,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and the area underneath sums up to 1.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Here's our Gaussian again.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If we call the space x, then the Gaussian is characterized by two parameters--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the mean, often abbreviated with the Greek letter μ, and the width of the Gaussian,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
often called the variance, and for reasons I don't want to go into,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
it's often written as a quadratic variable σ^2.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And Gaussian in 1D, which means the parameter space over here is 1 dimensional,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is characterized by μ and σ^2.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Rather than estimating the entire distribution as a histogram,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
our task in Kalman filters is to maintain a μ and a σ^2 that is our best estimate

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
of the location of the object we're trying to find.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The exact formula is an exponential of a quadratic function where we take

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the exponent of this complicated expression over here.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The quadratic difference of our query point x relative to the mean μ

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
divided by σ^2 multiplied by -1/2.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Now, if x equals μ then the numerator becomes 0,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and we have x of 0, which is 1.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It turns out we have to normalize this by a constant--

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
1 over the square root of 2πσ^2--

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
but for everything we'll talk about today, this constant won't matter, so ignore it.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
What matters is we have an exponential of a quadratic function over here.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Let me draw you a couple of functions, and you tell me which ones you believe

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
are Gaussian by checking the box on the right side.

00:02:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please excuse my poor drawing skills here.
