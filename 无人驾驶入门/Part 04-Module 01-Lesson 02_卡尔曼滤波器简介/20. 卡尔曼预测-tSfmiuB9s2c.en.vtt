00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is here.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What the Kalman filter does for you, if you do estimation and higher dimensional spaces,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is to not just go into x and y spaces,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but allows you to implicitly figure out what the velocity of the object is,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and then use the velocity estimate to make a really good prediction about the future.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now notice the sensor itself only sees position.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It never sees the actual velocity.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Velocity is inferred from seeing multiple positions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So one of the most amazing things about Kalman filters in tracking applications is

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it's able to figure out, even though it never directly measures it,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the velocity of the object, and from there is able to make predictions about future locations

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that incorporate velocity.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That is just really, really, really great.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That's one of the reasons that Kalman filters are such a popular algorithm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.541
in artificial intelligence and in control theory at large.
