00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let me ask you again about your intuition

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and draw three more Gaussians, and, again, excuse my poor drawing skills here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now I'm going to ask you about the covariance.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
For each of those check exactly one box.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Is the covariance large, medium, or small?

00:00:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Obviously, one of those is the largest, one is a medium, and one is small.
