00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me ask you a different quiz,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which from the math, but it tests your intuition.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Suppose we have a prior that sits over here

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and a measurement probability that sits over here--really far away--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and both have the same covariance.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let me first quiz you where the new mean would be.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Is it going to be here, here, here, or here?

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please check the corresponding check mark.
