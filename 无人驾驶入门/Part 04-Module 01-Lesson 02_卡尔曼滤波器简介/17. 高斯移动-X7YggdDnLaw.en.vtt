00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Thrun] So let's step a step back and look at what we've achieved.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We knew there was a measurement update and a motion update,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which is also called prediction.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And we know that the measurement update is implemented by multiplication,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which is the same as Bayes rule,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the motion update is done by total probability or an addition.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So we tackled the more complicated case.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is actually the hard part mathematically.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We solved this. We gave an exact expression.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We even derived it mathematically,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and you were able to write a computer program that implements this step of the Kalman filter.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I don't want to go into too much depth here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This is a really, really easy step. Let me write it down for you.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Suppose you live in a world like this.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is your current best estimate of where you are,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and this is your uncertainty.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now say you move to the right side a certain distance

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and that motion itself has its own set of uncertainty.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then you arrive at a prediction that adds the motion of command to the mean,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and it has an increased uncertainty over the initial uncertainty.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Intuitively this makes sense.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If you move to the right by this distance,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in expectation you're exactly where you wish to be

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
but you've lost information because your motion tends to lose information

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
as manifested by this uncertainty over here.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The math for this is really, really easy.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Your new mean is your old mean plus the motion, often called U.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So if you move over 10 meters, this will be 10 meters.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And your new σ² is your old σ²

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
plus a variance of the motion Gaussian.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This is all you need to know. It's just an addition.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I won't prove it to you because it's really trivial.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But in summary, we have a Gaussian over here,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we have a Gaussian for the motion, with U as the mean

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and r-squared as its own motion uncertainty,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and the resulting Gaussian in the prediction step just adds these 2 things up--

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
mu plus U and σ² plus r-squared.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Since this was so simple, let me quiz you.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We have a Gaussian before the prediction step

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
which mu equals 8 and σ² equals 4.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We then move to the right a total of 10,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
with a motion uncertainty of 6.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now describe to me the predictive Gaussian

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.747
and give me the new mu and the new σ².
