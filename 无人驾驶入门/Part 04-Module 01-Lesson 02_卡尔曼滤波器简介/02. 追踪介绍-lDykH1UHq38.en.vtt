00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And he asked you to expect it right over here.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
From those observations you would say that the velocity

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
points in the direction of this vector.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Assuming no drastic change in velocity,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you expect that the 5th position would be over here.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The common filter takes observations like these

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and estimates future locations and velocities based on data like this.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Today I'm going to teach you how to write a piece of software

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that let's you take points like those--even if they're noisy and uncertain--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and estimate automatically where future locations might be

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and at what velocity the object is moving.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The Google self-driving car uses methods like these to understand

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
where other traffic is based on radar and laser-range data.

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So let's dive in!
