00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The answer is this one is a Gaussian, this one, and this one.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
They are all characterized by this exponential drop-off on both sides

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that are symmetrical, and they have a single peak.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
They are what's called "unimodal."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is a bimodal function that has two peaks and as a result is not Gaussian.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The same is true over here and over here,

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
so these guys don't qualify.
