00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is the third, because that's the one that's most certain,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and because it is most certain, it makes a chance of accidentally

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
hitting another car the smallest just by the fact that we know more about the car

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
than in the two other distributions.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You learned something really important.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You learned the definition of a Gaussian.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You learned about the fact that these are unimodal distributions.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They are also symmetrical.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And you learned a little bit about how to use them as a belief in a probabilistic filter.

00:00:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let's go and program a Gaussian.
