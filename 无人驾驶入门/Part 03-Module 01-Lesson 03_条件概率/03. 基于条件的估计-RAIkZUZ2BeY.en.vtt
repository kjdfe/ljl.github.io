00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.695
All right, you've made a probabilistic estimate about the weather one year from now.

00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:08.669
Now, I'd like you to look out of a window.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:12.085
Go ahead, pause this video and go look out the nearest window.

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:14.940
I can wait. Did you do it?

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:19.289
Great. Now, I want you to make the same estimate you made before,

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.524
but this time I want you to estimate what is the probability that wherever you are now,

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.119
it will be cloudy one minute from now.
