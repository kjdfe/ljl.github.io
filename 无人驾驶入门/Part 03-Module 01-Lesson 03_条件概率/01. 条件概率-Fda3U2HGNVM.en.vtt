00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
Let's talk about conditional probabilities.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.710
Sounds very cryptic, but conditional probability is the basic mechanism

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.315
of which a self-driving car can take some sensor data and infer something else.

00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:15.539
Like for example, it could see a picture of a tree and infer,

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.129
"I'm about to crash."

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.769
To the language that is needed in mathematics to make

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.439
this inference from a sensor measurement to

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.000
some internal belief is called conditional probability. So let's dive in.
