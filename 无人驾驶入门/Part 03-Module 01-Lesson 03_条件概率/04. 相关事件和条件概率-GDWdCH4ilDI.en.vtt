00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.825
I'm going to guess you felt much more confident in that second estimate.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:07.080
So you probably estimated a probability that's very close to zero or one,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.769
depending on whether it is not or is cloudy right now.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.469
And that's because cloudiness now and cloudiness one

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.615
minute from now are not independent events.

00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:18.869
When you looked out the window to evaluate the cloudiness,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.769
you were in effect taking a sensor measurement of your surroundings,

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.030
and you used that data to inform your probabilistic estimate.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.250
And that is all that conditional probability is: taking

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.979
advantage of what we know to make better estimates about what we don't.

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:37.000
In the rest of this lesson you'll learn how to formalize the intuition mathematically.
