00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.674
As Sebastian said, this term,

00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:05.400
"conditional probability" sounds very cryptic.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.480
But before we jump into the math behind conditional probability,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.560
I want to show you that you already understand the concept intuitively.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.035
To do that, I'm going to ask you two questions.

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:17.629
Well, really, one question twice.

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:20.824
First, whatever town or city you're in right now,

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:23.869
I want you to come up with your best guess of the probability

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.000
that exactly one year from now it will be cloudy outside.
