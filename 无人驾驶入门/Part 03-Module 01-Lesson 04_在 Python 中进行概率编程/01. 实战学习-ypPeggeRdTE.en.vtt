00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
Gosh, after all these materials.

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:07.049
If you are like me, you really are totally antsy to get your hands dirty.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.669
Now comes the fun part.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.640
Now comes the part of this lesson that you get to show

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.740
your powers and build interesting programs based on what you've just learned.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.250
I actually firmly believe,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.515
that learning really takes place by doing.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:23.484
That you don't lose weight by watching other people exercise.

00:00:23.484 --> 00:00:28.244
You don't learn that much about probability without trying to program it yourself.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:29.925
So dive in, have fun,

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:35.000
and enjoy all these wonderful exercises put together for you to learn about probability.
