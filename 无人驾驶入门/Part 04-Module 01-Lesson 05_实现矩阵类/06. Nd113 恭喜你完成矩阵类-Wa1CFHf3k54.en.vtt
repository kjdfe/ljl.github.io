So very cool, you have your matrix class implemented.

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:05.535
Isn't that great?

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:06.780
I love that kind of code,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.519
it's so aesthetical and so beautiful and so reusable.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.059
I think if you get the passion that I have for instance just for the coding part of

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.370
it then you will become

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.000
a great software engineer because it's that passion that makes code really really great.
