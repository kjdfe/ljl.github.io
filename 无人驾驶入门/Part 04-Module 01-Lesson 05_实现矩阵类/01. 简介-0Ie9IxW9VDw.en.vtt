00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.165
Now, for the next project, I promise you,

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:04.674
if you make it through it,

00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:06.974
you'll have a huge grin on your face.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:09.660
And the reason is, it's the most amazing things to program,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.121
but it's not easy, okay?

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:14.970
So when I ask you to put together object-oriented programming

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.524
and matrices and build your own matrix and vector classes.

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:23.579
And you can cheat, you can go to Wikipedia and other places and look up things.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.384
But you have to do it on your own.

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:28.860
And we really want you to learn how to represent something as

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.479
complex as matrices elegantly in object-oriented code.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:36.259
Dive in, it'd be hard I promise you,

00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:39.533
but I promise also once you finish it,

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.000
you will have the biggest grin on your face possible.
