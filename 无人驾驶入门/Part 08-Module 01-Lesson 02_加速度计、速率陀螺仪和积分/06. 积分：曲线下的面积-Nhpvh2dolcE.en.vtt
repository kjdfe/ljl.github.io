00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
We're going to come back to the elevator example in a little bit.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.484
First, I want to remind you of something you saw a few of courses back.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:09.240
Earlier in this category,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.990
when you were learning about matrices in motion models,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.520
you may remember seeing a graph that looks something like this.

00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:22.679
And this was a graph of velocity in meters per second versus time in seconds.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.879
And back then, Suzanne told you that if you want to calculate

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:29.809
the displacement or distance moved between T1 and T2,

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:33.844
you could do so by finding the area under this curve.

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:38.475
And in this case, if T1 were two and T2 were four,

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:41.750
well that would mean that the width of this rectangle is just four minus

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.783
two which is two and the height of the rectangle,

00:00:44.783 --> 00:00:47.375
that's just one 100m/s.

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.107
I can use this equation,

00:00:49.107 --> 00:00:52.364
area = width * height to calculate that area.

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:54.570
And in this case, that would be two seconds,

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.929
times 100m/s and with it written out this way,

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.469
you can see something interesting.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.875
The seconds actually cancel and all I'm left with is this,

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.965
an area of 200 meters.

00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:12.752
And now you can see why I've been so focused on the unit's associate with motion,

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.634
because if you look at the units for the axes on this graph,

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:19.430
you can see that the vertical axis has units of meters per second,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.610
and the horizontal axis has units of seconds.

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.060
And when you multiply these units together, you're just left with meters.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.400
Whenever you calculate an integral,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.680
you'll be doing some sort of multiplication just like

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.320
this and you'll be looking at the units on the axis of

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.599
your graph to get a hint for

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:39.944
what the integral or area under the curve actually represents.

00:01:39.944 --> 00:01:42.109
Now I'd like you to think about a few questions

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.000
involving graphs of motion and areas under the curve.
