00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.104
So far, you've seen how you can integrate acceleration data

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:06.375
from an accelerometer to get change in velocity,

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:11.640
and you've seen how you can integrate velocity to get change in position or displacement.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.019
And displacement and velocity are important quantities to a self driving car,

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.794
so it's really fortunate that we can calculate them from accelerometer data.

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:21.675
But what about heading?

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:24.530
A self-driving car needs to know which way it's pointing,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.464
and one way you can do that is by keeping track of how much it turns.

00:00:28.464 --> 00:00:31.035
And luckily, the initial measurement units on

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:34.420
all self-driving cars contain what's called brake gyros,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.109
and these gyros measure something called angular velocity.

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:40.769
In the rest of this section, in the following notebook,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.320
you'll see how you can use angular velocity data

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.390
from these rate gyros to keep track of the cars
