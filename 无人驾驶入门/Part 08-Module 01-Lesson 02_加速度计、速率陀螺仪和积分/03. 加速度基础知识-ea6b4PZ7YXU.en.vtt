00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.288
Position, velocity, and acceleration are all related.

00:00:06.288 --> 00:00:09.445
And you've seen the velocity is the derivative of position,

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:13.280
and acceleration is the derivative of velocity.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.484
Before we jump into calculus,

00:00:14.484 --> 00:00:17.350
it's important to get a feel for what acceleration really means.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.145
And one way to do that is to look at the units associate with each of these quantities.

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:25.817
Position, for example, might be measured in miles or kilometers.

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:28.245
But most commonly, we're going to use meters,

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:33.850
which we abbreviate with a little m. And velocity is typically measured in units

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.405
like kilometers per hour or miles per hour or again,

00:00:40.405 --> 00:00:45.000
more commonly, meters per second.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.905
But notice that each of these units has a unit of distance

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:51.490
in the numerator and a unit of time in the denominator.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.960
And that's because velocity is the derivative of distance traveled,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.094
it's the rate of change of distance with respect to time.

00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:02.449
So what are the units associated with acceleration?

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.790
Well, I already said it's the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.720
So that means that the numerator should have units of

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.215
velocity and the denominator should have units of time.

00:01:13.215 --> 00:01:17.130
And in fact, these are the units we'll be using for acceleration.

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:18.674
And when you see them written this way,

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:21.030
you can read them as meters per second per second.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.230
Though often you'll see them in this way,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.570
in which case it's pronounced meters per second squared.

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:32.384
And personally, I really prefer the first way of writing these units

00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:36.015
since it serves as a good reminder for what acceleration actually is.

00:01:36.015 --> 00:01:39.859
It's the rate of change of velocity with respect to time.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.000
So that means acceleration just tells you how fast your velocity is changing.
