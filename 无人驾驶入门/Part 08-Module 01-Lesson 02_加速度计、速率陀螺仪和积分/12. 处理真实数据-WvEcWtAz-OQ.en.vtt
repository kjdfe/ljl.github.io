00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.245
At this point, you've calculated integrals of velocity data,

00:00:03.245 --> 00:00:06.200
acceleration data and angular velocity data.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.669
And hopefully, you're building

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.219
a good intuitive sense for what it means to take an integral.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.410
Now, I have a confession to make.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.814
Some of the real data I've been showing you has actually not been real.

00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:20.490
In fact, occasionally, I may have generated

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.714
fake data so the plots you made were clean and well behaved,

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:25.679
and the integrals all made sense.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.553
But in reality, sensors are never perfect.

00:00:28.553 --> 00:00:30.945
They're noisy, and they're often biased.

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:34.109
And it turns out that when you integrate imperfect data,

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.689
your errors tend to amplify.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:39.509
I don't want you to leave this nanodegree thinking that all you

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:43.015
need to localize a robot is an accelerometer and a rate gyro.

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:45.090
Because while these tools do help,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.680
they have their flaws as well.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.140
In the following segments, you're going to integrate

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.350
real data and explore some of the problems that arise when you.
