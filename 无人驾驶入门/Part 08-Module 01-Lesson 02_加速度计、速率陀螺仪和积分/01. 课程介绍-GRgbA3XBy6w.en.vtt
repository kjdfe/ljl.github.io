00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Welcome back. In the last lesson,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.695
you worked primarily with odometry data,

00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.995
which is just data about distance traveled.

00:00:06.995 --> 00:00:10.769
And specifically, you saw you can calculate the rate of change of

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.710
a vehicle's position with respect to time to figure out a vehicle's velocity.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.205
At the very end of the lesson,

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:21.614
you saw you can do the exact same thing with velocity data to get acceleration.

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:24.794
And calculating these rates of change is known as,

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.690
differentiation or taking the derivative.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.575
So the derivative of position is velocity and the derivative of velocity is acceleration.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:36.179
And this idea is really helpful.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.039
Understanding the derivative means that whenever you have access to position data,

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.039
you can also calculate the velocity and acceleration data.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.549
But what if we start with acceleration data and

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.419
we wanna say something about velocity or position?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.579
In this lesson, you're going to learn exactly how to do that by

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.000
calculating something called the integral of acceleration data.
