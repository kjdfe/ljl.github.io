00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.785
Congratulations on completing the lesson.

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:03.953
In a previous lesson,

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:07.665
you saw how the derivative of something like displacement gives velocity.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:10.289
And in this lesson, you saw the integral let's you go the other

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.125
way and calculate displacement from velocity,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.449
or even velocity from acceleration.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.024
And I hope at this point,

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:19.619
you have a conceptual understanding of what integral is,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.414
and why it can be useful for understanding the motion of a self-driving car.

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:27.794
But, I also want to say that if you've never taken the calculus class before,

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:29.423
or even if you have,

00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:32.725
you might be feeling a little overwhelmed right now and that's totally normal.

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:34.920
Calculus is really hard,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.490
and traditional calculus classes spend months covering integrals.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.984
As you keep working with and talking about motion, and rates of change,

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:43.700
and accumulation of change,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.450
you'll become more and more comfortable with concepts like derivatives and integrals.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.940
For now, I recommend you accept

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:52.949
any intellectual discomfort that you might be

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.445
feeling and prepare yourself for the next challenge,

00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:58.590
because in the next lesson you're going to be taking a crash course in

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.000
another amazing branch of mathematics called trigonometry.
