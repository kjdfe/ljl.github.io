00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
You just made a plot of acceleration versus time for

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.950
an elevator as it goes upwards from the ground floor and then stops two floors above.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.580
And that data looks something like this.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.160
Now, I want to call your attention to five regions of this data.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.230
The first section is from when I started collecting

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.365
data into when the elevator just started moving upwards.

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:23.109
The next section is that period of time when the acceleration is positive.

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.064
This is where the elevator gets up to speed

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:27.885
but it's also when you might feel a little lurch in your stomach.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:31.915
Then the acceleration is pretty much zero for a while.

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:36.009
This is when the elevator was just moving upwards at a more or less constant speed.

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.280
Next, in this segment,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.750
the acceleration becomes negative for

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.594
a few seconds and this is the elevator actually slowing down.

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:46.259
Finally, this last region is just everything I

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:50.579
collected after the elevator had stopped but before I stopped the accelerometer.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.634
And these two bumps,

00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:55.677
one in Region 2 and the other in Region 4,

00:00:55.677 --> 00:00:57.674
they looked very, very similar.

00:00:57.674 --> 00:01:02.159
The only obvious difference is that one is positive and one is negative.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.664
Besides that, they look basically like mirror images.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:07.440
And in fact, if you were to calculate the area under

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.905
this curve and compare it to the area under this curve,

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:13.349
you would find that they were exactly the same,

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:16.494
except for the fact that A4 is negative in a sense,

00:01:16.495 --> 00:01:18.840
and that's just because it extends down below

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.314
the horizontal line corresponding to zero acceleration.

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:24.814
This is not a coincidence.

00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:26.325
In the next few segments,

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:29.760
I want to convince you that the area under the green curve corresponds to

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.320
the total speed increase that happened in that time interval.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.189
And the area under the red curve corresponds to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.575
the total speed decrease that happened in that time interval.

00:01:38.575 --> 00:01:42.000
For now, I want you to think about this elevator's motion a bit more.
