00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
In the next notebook, you're going to learn a technique that will let you integrate

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.775
any function of a single variable and all it's going to take is a loop.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.675
Before you jump into this code,

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:14.040
let me briefly explain the theory behind what you're going to be doing.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.280
So, let's say you want to integrate velocity with respect to

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.804
time but your velocity is given by some pretty complicated function,

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:22.855
as is often the case in the real world.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:25.410
And let's say you want to use this velocity data to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.690
calculate your displacement from T equals one to T equals five.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:35.325
How do you calculate the area when the shape isn't a rectangle?

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:38.145
The trick is this, you just don't.

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:40.565
Instead, you approximate.

00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:43.469
So, let's start by making a really bad approximation,

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.839
where we just pretend the speed at the beginning is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.540
the speed throughout the entire four-second time interval.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.519
Well then, our area,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.070
it's just the height times the width.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.250
And in this case, the height would be the value of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.515
the velocity function evaluated T equals one, and the width.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:02.770
Well, that's just the time interval Delta T,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.728
which in this case is four seconds,

00:01:04.727 --> 00:01:07.429
but clearly, this is a really bad approximation.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.260
It fails to account for all of this area above the line.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.280
But no problem, let's improve our approximation.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.640
One way to do that is by breaking the single interval with a Delta T of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.879
four seconds into four time intervals with Delta T of one second.

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:25.039
And then, for this first time interval, from T equals one to two,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.820
we just draw a rectangle,

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:31.104
and then we use the velocity T equals one as the velocity for the whole interval.

00:01:31.105 --> 00:01:36.780
And then, we just repeat this procedure for two to three, three to four,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.739
and for T equals four to five and this

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:44.159
will give a better approximation of the actual area under the curve.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.015
But you probably notice it isn't perfect.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.965
In addition to underestimating in the first two segments,

00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:53.659
it actually overestimates in this last segment.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.079
So, while this is an improvement,

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.149
it's still just not good enough.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.305
Had we solved the problem? Well, we chop our graph up into smaller rectangles.

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:04.180
For example, we could use a time interval of half-a-second,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.233
and this is definitely getting better,

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:07.900
but we could go even smaller.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.045
As we reduce the width of these time intervals closer and closer to zero,

00:02:12.044 --> 00:02:15.884
we're going to get closer and closer to the true area under the curve.

00:02:15.884 --> 00:02:18.609
Okay, sorry. That's enough talking from me.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.155
I get very excited about the class.

00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:22.080
Why don't you go ahead and do this yourself?
