00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
When you calculate the area under a curve,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.054
what you're actually doing is taking an integral.

00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:09.449
And the mathematical symbol for the integral is this stretched out "S" looking shape.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.799
And often it'll have what are called bounds of integration at the bottom and the top.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.255
So, in this case, t1 is the lower bound and t2 is the upper bound.

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:21.994
And the integral is the opposite of the derivative.

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:25.780
So, since velocity is the derivative of displacement,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:32.164
this means that displacement is the integral of velocity. Let's go back to the graph.

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:35.990
Now remember that the area under this graph gives us the total displacement.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.155
Now I want to show you how to express this effect in integral notation.

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:44.804
The integral that expresses this exact same statement looks like this.

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:48.765
And the way I would read this is by saying delta x equals the

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:53.789
integral from two to four of 100 dt. And that's a lot.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.920
So, let me try to explain what this means.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.609
It won't all be perfectly clear just yet, but that's okay for now.

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.847
Total displacement.

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:03.908
Well, that we just represent with delta x.

00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:05.665
And that should be pretty familiar.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.330
Let's take a look on the right-hand side.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.429
Well, on the right-hand side we have this integral sign with the bounds of integration.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.880
The 100 and the "dt" to the right of it.

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:16.384
Let's talk about this "dt" for a second.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:19.620
There's always going to be a "d something" in an integral,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.560
and whatever that something is,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.945
in this case it's "t".

00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:26.754
It's just meant to tell you what these bounds of integration actually mean.

00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:29.480
So the fact that the something here is a "t", well,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.844
it means that this lower bound of integration is t equals

00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:38.189
2 and not x equals 2 or v equals 2 or anything else.

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.670
Now all that's left is this 100,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.299
and the reason this just happens to be a

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.924
simple 100 is because the velocity function was so simple.

00:01:45.924 --> 00:01:49.109
If on the other hand, the velocity function were more complicated,

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.204
like let's say 50 plus 20 times t then, instead of 100,

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:56.399
we'd have 50 plus 20 times t. And in general,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.725
this v(t) can really be anything.

00:01:58.724 --> 00:02:01.199
So we can write this generic version of the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.799
integral and this would work for any weird velocity function.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.194
Now if this all feels pretty overwhelming that's normal.

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:09.849
For now I just wanted to introduce you to a notation that you're

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.269
going to be seeing throughout your self-driving car career.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.000
And fortunately, computers make using this notation pretty straightforward.
