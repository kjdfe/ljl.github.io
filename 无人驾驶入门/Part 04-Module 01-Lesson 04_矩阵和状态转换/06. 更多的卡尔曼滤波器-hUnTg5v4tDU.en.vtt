00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
When you put all this together, you find that all these possibilites on the Gaussian over here,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
link to a Gaussian that looks like this.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is a really interesting 2-dimensional Gaussian, which you should really think about.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Clearly, if I were to project this Gaussian uncertainty into the space of possible locations,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I can't predict a thing. It's impossible to predict where the object is.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The reason is, I don't know the velocity.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Also, clearly if I project this Gaussian into the space of x dot,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it is impossible to say what the velocity is.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
A single observation or single prediction is insufficient to make that observation.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
However, what we know is our location is correlated to the velocity.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The faster I move, the further on the right is the location.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This Gaussian expresses this.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If I, for example, figure out that my velocity was 2, then I was able, under this Gaussian,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to really nail that my location is 3.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That is really remarkable.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You still haven't figured out where you are, and you haven't figured out how fast you're moving,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but we've learned so much about the relation of these 2 things with this tilted Gaussian.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
To understand how powerful this is, let's now fold in the second observation at time t = 2.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This observation tells us nothing about the velocity and only something about the location.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So if I were to draw this as a Gaussian--it's a Gaussian just like this,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
which says something about the location but not about the velocity.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But if we multiply my prior from the prediction step with the measurement probability,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
then miraculously, I get a Gaussian that sits right over here.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This Gaussian now has a really good estimate what my velocity is

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and a really good estimate where I am.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If I take this Gaussian, and predict 1 step forward, then I find myself right over here.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That's exactly the effect we have over here.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
After that I get a Gaussian like this, I predict right over here.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Think about this. This is a really deep insight about how Kalman filters work.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In particular, we've only been able to observe 1 variable.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We've been able to measure observation to infer this other variable,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and the way we've been able to infer is that there's a set of physical equations

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
which say that my location, after a times step, is my old location plus my velocity.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This set of equations has been able to propagate constraints from subsequent measurements

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
back to this unobservable variable, velocity, so we are able to estimate the velocity as well.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
This is really key to understanding Kalman filter.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It is key to understanding how a Google self-driving car,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
estimates the locations of other cars, and is able to make predictions

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
even if it's unable to measure velocity directly.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
There's a big lesson here.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The variables of a Kalman filter--they're often called states because they reflect states

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
of the physical world like where the other car is and how fast it's moving.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
They separate into 2 subsets--the observables, like the momentary location,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and the hidden, which in our example is the velocity, which I can never directly observe.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But because those 2 things interact, subsequent observations of the observable variables

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
give us information about these hidden variables, so we can also estimate

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
what these hidden variables are.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So from multiple observations of the places of the object--the location--

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
we can estimate how fast it's moving.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
That is actually true for all of the different filters but because Kalman filters happen to be

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
very efficient to calculate, when we have a problem like this,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.051
you tend to often use just a Kalman filter.
