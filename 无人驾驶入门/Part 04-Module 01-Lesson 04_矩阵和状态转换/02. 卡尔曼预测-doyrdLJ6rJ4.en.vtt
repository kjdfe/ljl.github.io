00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now we understand a lot about the 1D Kalman filter.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You've programmed one. You understand how to incorporate measurements.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You understand how to incorporate motion,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and you really implement something that's actually really cool,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which is a full Kalman filter for the 1D case.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now in reality, we often have many Ds,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then things become more involved, so I'm going to just tell you how things work

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with an example, and why it's great to estimate in higher dimensional state spaces.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Suppose you have a 2-dimensional state space of x and y--like a camera image,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or in our case, we might have a car that uses a radar to detect the location

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of a vehicle over time.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Then what the 2D Kalman filter affords you is something really amazing,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and here is how it goes.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Suppose at time t = 0, you observe the object of interest to be at this coordinate.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This might be another car in traffic for the Google self-driving car.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
One time step later, you see it over here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Another time step later, you see it right over here.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Where would you now expect at time t = 3 the object to be?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let me give you 3 different places.

00:01:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
