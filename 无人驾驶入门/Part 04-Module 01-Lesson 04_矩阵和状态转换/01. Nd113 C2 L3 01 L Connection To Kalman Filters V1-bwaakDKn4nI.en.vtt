00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.229
Right now we've got a few threads in our hands.

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:04.706
We've got Kalman filters,

00:00:04.706 --> 00:00:07.939
matrices and vectors, and object-oriented programming.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.510
And you might be starting to see how these threads all intertwine. But maybe not.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.310
At the end of this course,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.280
you're going to implement a matrix class which will be

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.700
used to make a multidimensional Kalman filter actually work.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.839
And once you do that,

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.940
it should be crystal clear how these threads all intertwine.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.400
But for now, you've got a bit more work to do with Kalman filters.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.910
So we're going to pick up where

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.585
the Kalman filter lesson you were watching earlier left off.

00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:35.310
And just to remind you of where you were when you left off,

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.039
we're going to show you the very last video you saw from that lesson again. Enjoy.
