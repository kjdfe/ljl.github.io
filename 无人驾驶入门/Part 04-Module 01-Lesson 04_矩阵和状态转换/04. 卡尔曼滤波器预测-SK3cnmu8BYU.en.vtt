00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is right over here. Why?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If a car's starting point is the point over here, for which we know the location is 1,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and the velocity is 1, and if we predict 1 time step in the future,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
then for that prediction, we know the location will be 2,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and the velocity might be a little uncertain, but it stays about the same.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.741
So we end up with a point over here. Let's do this again.
