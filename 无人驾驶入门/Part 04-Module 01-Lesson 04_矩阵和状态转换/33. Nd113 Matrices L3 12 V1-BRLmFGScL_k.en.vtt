00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.029
This is a lot of math and I get it.

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:07.554
I can tell you I don't myself remember all these formulas.

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:09.119
I have to look them up.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.068
I remember in early days with Udacity,

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:13.050
I made a course on Robotics where

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.815
I couldn't remember how to invert matrices so I go with it.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:19.080
I stole a piece of code and then my team were

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.419
really mad at me for stealing code from somebody else.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.987
Even though everybody steals code these days.

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:26.369
I'd be going with you through this,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.275
so you get an understanding of the Basic Linear Algebra.

00:00:29.274 --> 00:00:31.079
And trust me, even if you

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.524
understand it in the everyday what a matrix is and what a vector is,

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:34.934
and know what you can do with it,

00:00:34.935 --> 00:00:36.420
no matter how it's worth,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.730
that's very, very useful because it let's you do stuff

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.159
in Multi-Dimensional Spaces and robots,

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.349
the self-driving cars live in Multi-Dimensional Spaces,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.270
maps are High-Dimensional Spaces.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000
So let's forge on.
