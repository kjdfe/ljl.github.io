00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.049
These are the common filter equations in all their beautiful complexity.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.915
But what do they all mean.?

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:10.199
Before we jump into all the matrix math behind these equations,

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.570
I'd like to just do some basic visual cleanup.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.094
And to do that, I want to make three modifications to these equations.

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:19.349
Let's just focus on this first equation

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.737
here so I can explain what those modifications are.

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:26.324
The first thing I'm going to do to all these equations,

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:28.439
is just get rid of these hats,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.865
like hats you saw at the x.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:33.405
While the hat does have physical significance

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.015
it indicates that this variable is an estimate.

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:39.984
It's not for sure. It doesn't have any mathematical significance.

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:43.329
It's not telling us to do anything mathematically with these equations,

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.659
so just get rid of those for now.

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.139
Next, we're going to take all these x_k giving

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.700
k - 1 and we're going replace that with x'.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.250
Not only is this easier to look at.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.950
It's also consistent with the notation you've been using with Sebastian.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.950
Finally we're just going to get rid of these lone k's,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.395
they're cluttering things up and I'd rather just look at an equation like this.

00:01:07.394 --> 00:01:10.236
Now we have this simplified equation.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:13.589
Remember it's some math here just looks simpler.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.329
Let's take a look what happens to all of

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.209
the call filter equations when we apply these same three cleaning steps.

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:22.049
We take equations which looked like these and we

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.087
convert them to equations that look like these.

00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:28.409
This representation really let's us focus on

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.629
the mathematical tools we're going to need in

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:33.714
order to make Wikipedia articles useful to us.

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:36.600
In fact, we can actually use certain aspects of these equations

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.324
right now to highlight what we're going to cover in the rest lesson.

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:42.540
First, let's focus on the difference

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.605
between lower case and upper case, there's actually meaning there.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:49.710
Generally, lower case variables indicate

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.289
vectors while uppercase variables indicate matrices.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.455
We'll talk more about this distinction in a minute.

00:01:55.454 --> 00:02:01.064
We'll also talk about addition and multiplication of vectors and matrices.

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:04.585
We'll discuss one particularly special matrix called the identity

00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:10.469
matrix and we'll talk about two additional important operations called the transpose,

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.835
given by this little T superscript and the Matrix inverse,

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:18.330
given by this little -1 superscript.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.548
If this seems like an overwhelming amount of stuff to learn in a very short time,

00:02:22.548 --> 00:02:26.574
remember the goal here is not to memorize any of this.

00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:28.139
The goal isn't even really to get

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.844
a conceptual understanding of linear algebra that will come with time.

00:02:32.844 --> 00:02:34.349
The goal now is to acquire

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.909
a basic functional familiarity with the tool that is matrix math,

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.000
so that when you encounter it in future Google searches you'll know where to begin.
