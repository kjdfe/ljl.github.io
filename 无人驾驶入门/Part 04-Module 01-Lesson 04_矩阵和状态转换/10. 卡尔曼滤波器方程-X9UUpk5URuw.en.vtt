00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
For the rest of this course,

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:05.084
we are going to focus on building a working knowledge of matrix math,

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:07.525
which is also known as linear algebra.

00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:09.990
But what do I mean by working knowledge?

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.955
As Sebastian has repeatedly said,

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:14.865
it is not important to memorize equations,

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.385
but as a self-driving car engineer,

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:19.890
it will be important for you to be able to find and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.245
use the equations you need when you need to use them.

00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:25.605
So imagine that at some point in the future,

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:29.609
you're working on the traffic protection team for some self-driving car company,

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.045
and you're trying to build a prototype of some object tracking code.

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:34.910
You might create a file called,

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.107
I don't know, Kalman filter dot pi,

00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:40.042
and then, well, if you're like most people,

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.756
you probably have to go to Google.

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:44.159
And once you're there,

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.219
you'd start typing in Kalman filter,

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.089
and you'd see a list of results.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.863
And, as you can tell, I personally like Wikipedia.

00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:54.829
And what you'd see would look something like this.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.384
And since you wouldn't be looking to look through all the theory,

00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:02.039
you'd probably scroll right down to the common filter equations,

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.359
which looks something like this.

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:08.789
And, unsurprisingly, there is separated entry predict and an update step.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.160
And you probably have an understanding of what those mean conceptually.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.504
But that doesn't necessarily mean you could do anything with all these equations,

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:18.390
and that's kind of a shame.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.570
So the goal for this course and the project that falls is

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.839
to make sure that when you see equations that look like these,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.240
you'll be able to put them to use in the future.

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:30.179
What that means is you can translate

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.750
the matrix math that you see in a page like Wikipedia into real code.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.000
So let's begin.
