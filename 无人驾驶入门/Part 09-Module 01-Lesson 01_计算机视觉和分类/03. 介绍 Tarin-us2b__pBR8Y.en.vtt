To help us learn about computer vision techniques and applications,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.314
we have with us an industry expert,

00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:09.000
Tarin Ziyaee, the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Voyage,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.634
a self driving car company.

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:12.359
Hi. Thank you Suzanne.

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.849
I'm very glad to be here and thank you for having me.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.195
Yes, computer vision is very close to our hearts here at Voyage.

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:20.129
It's something that's ubiquitous in the industry,

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:21.730
and also very important.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.585
The obvious uses of computer vision here are for example,

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:29.280
the recognition of what's data traffic light is in or the detection of lanes, etc.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.975
One cool thing about computer vision though,

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:33.015
is that those techniques that we will learn about

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.490
will not only be used with the camera images,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.776
but also images created with other sensors.

00:00:37.776 --> 00:00:40.170
In fact, as long as your data has what we call

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.260
spatial coherency you can use computer vision techniques.

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:46.170
And spatially coherent data can be thought of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.332
as any data that predictably varies over space,

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:50.484
like sound for example.

00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:52.784
If you hear sound from a speaker close up,

00:00:52.784 --> 00:00:54.044
it will sound very loud.

00:00:54.045 --> 00:00:55.500
But the farther you get away,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.179
the softer the sound will get.

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.530
And so the volume of the sound can give you spatial information.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.387
That's right. So addition to cameras,

00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:04.969
self driving cars use sensors like sonar,

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:07.170
radar and lidar, which use sound waves and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.504
electromagnetic waves to gather data about the car's surroundings.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:13.000
Next, let's take a closer look at these sensors.
