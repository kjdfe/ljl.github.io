00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
After exploring the day and night image data,

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.375
you may have noticed a part of the data that we haven't yet gone over,

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.269
a label associated with each image.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.219
So what exactly is a label and why do we need it?

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.600
A label is kind of like a tag that's attached to

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.507
a specific image and that tells you something about that image.

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:22.184
You can think of a label sort of like a name tag.

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:27.699
I wear a name tag to events when I meet new people and my name tag labels me as Cezanne.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.554
Now, an image can have multiple labels that describe it,

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:33.375
which would be like if I had multiple labels like "human"

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:36.704
or "wears glasses" that each described something about me.

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:40.295
But for this lesson, we'll be working with one label per image.

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:43.320
These labels separate the image data into classes,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.155
and classes are like general categories.

00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:48.060
So the label for me might be human,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.844
which is a category distinct from a label like a table or a car or any other thing,

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.829
and it's more general than a label like Cezanne.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.159
So for the image datasets we work with,

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.004
we should have as many labels as we have classes.

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:02.910
In the case of our day and night images,

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.834
we have two labels, day and night.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:08.072
Now, why do we need these labels?

00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:10.739
You can tell if an image is night or day but

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:14.489
a computer cannot unless we tell it explicitly with a label.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:16.859
This becomes especially important when we're testing

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.775
the accuracy of a classification model.

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:23.175
A classifier takes in an image as input and should output

00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:27.509
a predicted label that tells us the predicted class of that image.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.700
Now, when we load in data like you've seen,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.100
we load in what are called the true labels,

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:36.074
and the true label is just the correct label for that image.

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:38.780
To check the accuracy of our classifier,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.204
we compare the predicted and true labels.

00:01:41.204 --> 00:01:43.524
If the true and predicted labels match,

00:01:43.525 --> 00:01:45.705
then we've classified the image correctly.

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:47.873
But sometimes, the labels do not match,

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:50.159
which means we've misclassified an image.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.500
After looking at many, many images,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.359
the accuracy of a classifier is defined as the number of correctly classified images,

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.037
for which the predicted label matches the true label,

00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:02.734
divided by the total number of images.

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:08.460
So say we tried to classify 100 total images and we correctly classified 81 of them,

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.355
meaning we misclassified 19 of them.

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:15.719
That would mean we'd have 0.81 or 81 percent accuracy.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.120
And we can only tell a computer to check the accuracy of

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.200
a classifier when we have these predicted and true labels to compare.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.939
We can also learn from any mistakes

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.835
the classifier makes as we'll see later in this lesson.

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:29.010
As a note, it's good practice to use

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.879
numerical labels instead of strings or categorical labels.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.310
Numbers are easier to track and compare.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.875
So for our day and night binary class example,

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:39.870
instead of day and night labels,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.670
we'll use the numerical labels zero for night and one for day.

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.569
Okay. Now you're familiar with

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.614
the day and night image data and you know what a label is and why we use them.

00:02:49.615 --> 00:02:51.030
You're ready for the next steps.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.775
We'll be building a classification pipeline from start to end.

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:58.200
Let's first brainstorm what steps we'll take to classify these images.
