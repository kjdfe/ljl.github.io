00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
Oh my God. I'm so proud of you.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.611
You've just finished the entire nanodegree introduction to self-driving cars,

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:12.510
and I know it wasn't easy.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.529
You've climbed a mountain you've never climbed before,

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.780
but now you understand so much about the field.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.890
And I'm proud of your grit to make it to this point.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.179
Congratulations.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.725
Now you should know we have a follow on nanodegree program on self-driving car.

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:32.314
That one is in many ways more real.

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:34.414
You're going to visit all the topics you've learned,

00:00:34.414 --> 00:00:35.960
like pathfinding and controls,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.310
and perception of the [inaudible].

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.190
We're going to make it more real by putting real data

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.265
in and making the challenges much more challenging.

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:45.323
That is the one this nanodegree is where

00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:47.839
our students massively find jobs here in Silicon Valley,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.195
and companies like Waymo,

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:52.140
Tesla and many others,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.839
and you're invited to take it.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.420
But meanwhile I wanted to celebrate,

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.100
and tell your parents and your friends about it.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.054
This has been a great accomplishment.

00:01:01.054 --> 00:01:03.049
Congratulations.
