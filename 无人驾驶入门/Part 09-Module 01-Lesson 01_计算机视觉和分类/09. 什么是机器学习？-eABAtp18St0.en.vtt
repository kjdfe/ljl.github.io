00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
When we talk about machine learning,

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:05.622
you'll often hear the terms 'deep learning' and 'neural networks' come up,

00:00:05.622 --> 00:00:08.370
and this might conjure up an image of a brain or

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.130
some strange graphic of layers of mathematical formulas and data.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.820
But at their core, all of these learning techniques are

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.150
about separating data into different classes.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.260
The image that this conjures in my head is of a child playing on a beach.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.240
The child sees some blue and yellow shells in the sand.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.670
Then someone says to the child,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.986
"Put these shells into groups and draw a line between them".

00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:32.160
Without me telling you anything else,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.116
how would you group these shells?

00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:36.585
You might separate them by color and shape,

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.510
and draw a line in the sand.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.405
Now, for a computer, this scenario might be that we give it individual images of shells.

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:44.490
And just like a child,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.130
a neural network can learn how to separate these images of

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.450
shells based on similarities or differences in the given examples.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.370
After the separation step,

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.425
if a network sees a new image,

00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:56.895
one it hasn't seen before,

00:00:56.895 --> 00:01:01.220
it sorts and classifies it based on which side of the line it falls.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.155
Realistically, data is often a lot more complex than this,

00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:06.780
but neural networks just layer separation on top of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.640
separation layer to create more complex boundaries and group all kinds of data.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.000
Next, we'll look at how a neural network can be trained to separate data.
