00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
You've been building up a solid foundation of programming and data analysis skills.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.969
And in this section,

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:10.872
I'm excited to introduce you to one more self-driving car tool, computer vision.

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:12.599
Computer vision is how machines like

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.449
self-driving cars visually perceive the world and respond to it.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.239
Imagine that you're driving a car,

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.854
you have to use your senses to notice pedestrians,

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:24.750
other cars, bicyclists, and all the road and traffic markings around you.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.230
This is similar to how a self-driving cars sees the world.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.899
It gathers data through cameras and other sensors,

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.015
and then uses that input to safely navigate and move through the world.

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:38.969
In this lesson, we'll learn about common computer vision techniques that are used

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.176
to analyze camera images and extract important information from them,

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:45.865
like the color or shape of different objects.

00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:47.219
We'll also briefly talk about

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.744
machine learning and how it's used in combination with computer vision

00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:53.129
to give machines a way to learn from data and

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.000
recognize patterns in images. Let's get started.
