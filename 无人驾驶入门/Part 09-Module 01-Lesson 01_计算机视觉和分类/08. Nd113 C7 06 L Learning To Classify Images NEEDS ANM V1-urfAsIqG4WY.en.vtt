00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.248
You've just seen a complete classification pipeline.

00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:06.210
For an image classifier starting with some input images,

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.390
computer vision techniques are used to process those images and

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.589
extract features like distinguishing colors or shapes in that image.

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.190
Then a classifier looks at these features and outputs a class,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.695
which is a label that describes the image.

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:21.899
A classifier should predict that images with

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.119
similar shapes or colors have the same class.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.200
We usually tell a classification model what to look for.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.300
For example, say we're looking at a bunch of

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.359
images and we want to classify them into two classes,

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:34.994
"car" and "not car."

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:39.414
To classify a car, we might write a program that looks for the different parts of a car,

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:41.875
wheels, lights, windows, and so on.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.770
And then if those things are found,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.060
we'll classify an image as a "car."

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.640
We decide what traits are important to look for.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.024
But there's another way to create a classifier,

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:52.755
and that's with machine learning.

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:55.469
Machine learning allows a computer to figure out things

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.560
on its own by giving it lots of examples.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.164
So instead of telling a model what traits to look for, with machine learning,

00:01:02.164 --> 00:01:04.379
we'd just give it lots of images of cars and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.864
not cars and let it learn to recognize traits that differentiate them.

00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:12.959
It can learn to recognize wheels and windows and which classification algorithm is

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:18.179
best for accurately classifying any given image as "car" or "not car."

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.430
Now you might be wondering how exactly does

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.670
a model like this learn to classify different images.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.980
Next, we'll look at how machine learning techniques can

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.000
actually be trained to classify sets of images.
