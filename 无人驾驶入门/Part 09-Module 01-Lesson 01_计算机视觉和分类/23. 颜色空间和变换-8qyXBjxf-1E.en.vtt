00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
So you've seen how to detect and mask a green screen background,

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:07.740
but this detection relied on a few assumptions to work.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.780
It assumed that the scene was very well lit

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.689
and that the screen was a very consistent green color.

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.239
What would happen if the lighting changed or if part of

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.280
the background was in shadow or washed out and bright?

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.115
A simple RGB threshold wouldn't work very well in this scenario.

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:26.519
So how can we consistently detect objects under varying light conditions?

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.829
Well, there are many other ways to represent

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.619
the colors in an image besides just composed of red,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.060
green, and blue values.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.440
These different color representations are often called color spaces.

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:40.094
RGB is red, green, blue color space.

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:42.509
You can think of this as a 3D shape,

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:43.559
a cube in this case,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.465
where any color can be represented by a 3D coordinate of R, G, and B values.

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:52.755
For example, white at this corner has a value of 255 for red,

00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:54.830
green, and blue values.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.274
There's also HSV color space for hue, saturation,

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:03.259
and value, and HLS for hue, lightness, and saturation.

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.864
These two spaces separate out the apparent brightness

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:08.989
and the color in an image into separate components.

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:11.295
For example, in HSV color space,

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:14.629
the value or V component is a good measure of brightness.

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:16.649
A high value means it's very light,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.500
and a low value means it's very dark.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.025
The saturation component is a good measure for color intensity.

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:27.780
Hue is a measurement that indicates the actual color of something, like whether it's red,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.700
or green, or purple, and so on,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.020
and it should stay fairly consistent in shadow or excessive brightness.

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:37.765
Because these spaces separate color and brightness into different channels,

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:41.984
these are some of the most commonly used colors bases in image processing.

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:44.129
Next, we'll see why they're so useful by going through

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:48.000
an example of converting an image to HSV color space.
