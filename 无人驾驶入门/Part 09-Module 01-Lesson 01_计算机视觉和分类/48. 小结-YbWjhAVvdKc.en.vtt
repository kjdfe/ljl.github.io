00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
Congratulations, you've really made it through a lot of

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.044
material from probability to classification.

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:10.500
In this lesson, you learned how to manually program a classifier step-by-step.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.320
First, by looking at a classification problem,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.519
and your images, and planning up a complete approach to a solution.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.769
These steps, include pre-processing images so

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.579
that they could be further analyzed in the same way.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.000
This included changing color spaces.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.289
Then, we moved on to feature extraction in which you decided on

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.179
distinguishing traits in each class of image and tried to isolate those features.

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.034
Finally, you created a complete classifier that output a label or a class

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:41.875
for any given image and analyzed your classification model to see its accuracy.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:46.230
Now, you're ready to build a more complex classifier and complete this program.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:47.549
Good luck and great.
