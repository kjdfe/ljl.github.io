00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
When you approach a classification challenge,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:05.424
you may ask yourself, "How can I tell these images apart?

00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:08.529
What traits do these images have that differentiate them?

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.774
And how can I write code to represent their differences?"

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:16.844
Adding onto that, how can I ignore irrelevant or overly similar parts of these images?

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:20.204
You may have thought about a number of distinguishing features.

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:23.529
Day images are much brighter generally than night images.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.700
Night images also have these really bright small spots,

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.199
so the brightness over the whole image varies a lot more than the day images.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.399
There's also a lot more of a gray blue color palette in the day images.

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.384
There are lots of measurable traits that distinguish these two types of images,

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:43.094
and these measurable traits are referred to as features.

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:46.439
A feature is a measurable component of an image or object that's

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:50.735
ideally unique and recognizable under varying conditions,

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:53.219
like under a varying light or camera angles.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.439
And we'll learn more about features soon,

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:57.239
but we're getting ahead of ourselves.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.310
To extract features from any image,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.130
we have to pre-process and standardize them.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.650
Next, we'll take a look at the standardization steps we

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.380
should take before we can consistently extract features.
