00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.714
All right. 101, Feature Extraction.

00:00:02.714 --> 00:00:06.285
Feature extraction is what your brain does with you all the time when you look, okay?

00:00:06.285 --> 00:00:10.199
So you get, in your retina you get the same coloration effects,

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:11.744
not exactly the same matrix,

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:14.109
but, for the time being, assume it's the same.

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.169
And then your visual cortex,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.175
the brain tissue behind your eye all the way to the back of your brain,

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:26.035
goes in and extracts higher and higher-level features all the way to, "This is Sebastian.

00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:27.949
This is a stop sign, " okay?

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.158
In these layers of feature extraction,

00:00:30.158 --> 00:00:31.379
you become more and more abstract.

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:33.030
You're going to start very simple right now,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.079
you're going to look at traffic scenes and extract simple features like,

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.699
"Is it daytime, or is it nighttime?"

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.325
And you'll be asked to develop, with a software that does this,

00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:45.150
as the very first step into making self-driving cars intelligent.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.549
And later on, we're going to give you traffic lights,

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.424
and we'll have you extract features from traffic lights.

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:53.489
It's not going to be all of self driving cars, but, hopefully,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.700
you understand how beautiful, and how imaginative,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.000
and how great it is to make a car see.
