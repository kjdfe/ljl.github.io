00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.315
Now, you're on your way to being able to build a complete classifier.

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:07.720
You know how to analyze color and brightness in a given image,

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:10.754
and that skill alone can help you distinguish between say,

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:13.770
a red stop sign, and a green informational sign.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.754
And I'm going to give you a classification challenge.

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:19.710
What if I asked you to classify two types of images

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.429
taken during either the day or at night when the sun has set?

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.984
And I want you to separate these images into two classes: day or night.

00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:32.119
This is actually an important classification challenge for self driving cars.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.280
These cars need to know what kind of conditions they're driving in,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.800
so that they can safely navigate a road at any time of day.

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:42.794
And so that they can still recognize other vehicles and surrounding objects,

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:45.594
whether it's dark or light outside.

00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:48.435
We'll walk through each classification step together.

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:50.580
But what do you think would be the first step in

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.789
creating a classification model for day and night images?

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.460
Before you can classify any set of images,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.020
you have to look at them.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.600
Visualizing the image data you're working with is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.034
the first step in identifying any patterns in image data,

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:07.019
and being able to make predictions about that data.

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:08.759
So, we'll first load in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.000
this image data and learn a bit about the images we'll be working with.
