00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
We know about how color images are represented numerically.

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:08.734
And next, I want to show you how color can be used in image analysis and transformation.

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.719
We'll start by learning how to use information about the colors in

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.545
an image to isolate a particular area in an image.

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:17.980
This is easiest to understand in an example.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.719
We'll be selecting an area of interest using a color threshold.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.599
Color thresholds are used in a number of applications,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.230
including extensively in computer graphics and video.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.330
A common use is with a green screen.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.299
A green screen is used to where two images or

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:38.009
video streams based on identifying and replacing a large green area.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:39.409
So how does all this work?

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:42.419
Well, the first step is to isolate the green background and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.810
then replace that green area with an image of your choosing.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.295
This task seems simple enough.

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:50.130
So let's see how to do this programmatically with our own image.
