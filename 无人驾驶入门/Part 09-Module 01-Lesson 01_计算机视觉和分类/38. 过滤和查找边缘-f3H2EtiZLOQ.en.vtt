00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
Now, we've seen how to use color to help isolate

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:06.769
a desired portion of an image and even help classify an image.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.570
In addition to taking advantage of color information,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.980
we also have knowledge about patterns of grayscale intensity in an image.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.324
Intensity is a measure of light and dark similar to brightness,

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:21.719
and we can use this knowledge to detect other areas or objects of interest.

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.210
For example, you can often identify the edges of

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.670
an object by looking at an abrupt change in intensity,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.609
which happens when an image changes from a very dark to light area, or vice versa.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:33.862
To detect these changes,

00:00:33.862 --> 00:00:37.380
you'll be using and creating specific image filters that look

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.620
at groups of pixels and detect big changes in intensity in an image.

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:45.114
These filters produce an output that shows any edges.

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:47.969
Let's learn more about these filters and see where they're useful in

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.000
processing images and identifying traits of interest.
