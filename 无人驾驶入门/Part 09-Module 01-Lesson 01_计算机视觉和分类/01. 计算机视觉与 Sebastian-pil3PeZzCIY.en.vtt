00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
Now, we come to the real magic in this course.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.930
One of my favorite topics,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.530
which is computer vision, making self driving car see.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.065
So when you open your eyes,

00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:13.830
then somehow magically, you understand what a coffee cup is,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.339
what a smartphone is, what Sebastian is.

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.940
Somehow your brain doesn't tell you the raw pixel information.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.755
It tells you all the options in the scene.

00:00:22.754 --> 00:00:26.984
Now, self driving cars unfortunately, are bit disadvantaged.

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:29.144
They have a camera just like this one over here,

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.169
and the camera produces an image,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.815
like this image over here,

00:00:32.814 --> 00:00:35.669
and the image is a big matrix of numbers.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.000
There's a pixel in the top left corner, that's pixel 11.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.054
And then, the pixel next to it, pixel 21, and pixel 31,

00:00:41.054 --> 00:00:43.944
and so on, till pixel whatever, 1024,

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:47.385
whatever the number is.

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:50.009
And each of these now have a coloration.

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:52.004
They have a amount of red,

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:53.920
an amount of blue, an amount of green.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.530
Okay, that's all you get. Okay, so,

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.505
you won't get this nice. Oh my God!

00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:00.570
There's obviously some reflector over here in the image,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.820
you will get those pixel matrix.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.099
And computer vision is all about extracting from

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.899
that vast matrix of image data the objects that you can see.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.125
So, picture this.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.234
Now, you got to get an image of a stop sign.

00:01:14.234 --> 00:01:15.769
And for each of these numbers that appear,

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:17.784
you get the right coloration number.

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:21.030
And you have to see where in the image is the stop sign.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.500
Not yourself, not your brain,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.700
not your visual cortex,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.000
but your piece of computer software.
