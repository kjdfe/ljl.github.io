00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.495
Welcome to the amazing world of bayesian thinking.

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:07.570
Reverend Thomas Bayes, a long time ago,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.234
invented Bayes' rule to prove the existence of God.

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:16.350
I actually got my tenure at Stanford by applying Bayes' rule to robotics.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.200
Bayes' rule is one of the most fascinating technologies

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.574
as we transform the field of robotics.

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:24.364
Let me explain to you why. Normal AI

00:00:24.364 --> 00:00:27.744
people used to assume everyone knows everything about the world.

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:29.380
When the world was wrong,

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:31.730
it would make fatal mistakes.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.814
Bayes' rule permits for the possibility that it was might be uncertain,

00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:40.445
they might not know, and they might have to explore the world to gain information.

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:44.679
The mathematical framework to gather information is called statistics,

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.549
and Bayes' rule was at the core of statistics.

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.149
It sounds cryptic? Well that's okay.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.795
That sounds let it sound cryptic because the session is about finding out the details.

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:56.020
I have to warn you,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.180
there are some very basic math involved,

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.630
things like linear algebra and probabilities.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.410
If you feel uncomfortable with those,

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.810
please go back and refresh those.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
The underlying concepts should be extremely intuitive,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.625
as intuitive as counting.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:14.000
So welcome to the wonderland of Bayes' law.
