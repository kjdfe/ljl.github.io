00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.879
Yes, I would love to talk more about object oriented programming.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:05.695
Often I want to solve things with functions,

00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:07.110
I think I'm inclined to think that way.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.185
But I know there is value in thinking object orintendly.

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:13.080
Why when designing a self-driving car,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.330
for example, why do we want to use object oriented programming?

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.065
Object oriented programming has the advantage of being modular and testable,

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:24.375
and that is important.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:31.350
But also with self-driving cars you can see the objects, they're physical things.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.920
The more you can work with an object that's

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.015
really something you feel like you could touch,

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:40.664
that helps define your code.

00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:46.320
And then it goes back to making good separation between one piece of code or another.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.625
Because if you have a wheel class which maybe not where we're going here,

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:52.109
but a wheel class,

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.964
it turns, it has tread,

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:56.760
it has all of these things.

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.244
And you can have four of them,

00:00:58.244 --> 00:01:01.195
and they can be similar but not the same.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:05.310
And then you have a sensor class for seeing where the lanes are,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.240
which might include a camera,

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:10.439
but that camera class might be used from other people.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.004
You can end up with a hugely complicated system,

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.289
but if everything is self-contained and very object-y,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.600
very individual and encapsulated into its own separate thing,

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:28.319
then as you change the wheels to different wheels or you go to a flying car,

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.079
you can just swap that out.
