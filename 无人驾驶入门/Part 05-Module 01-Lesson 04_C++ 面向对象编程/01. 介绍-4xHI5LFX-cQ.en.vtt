00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.625
C++ is a lifelong learning opportunity.

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:07.169
Here's a secret on me: in most of my life I wrote my code in

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:13.570
C++ and to the present day there's C++ code I would not be able to understand.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.519
And the reason is there's a lot of things in C++ that are really complicated.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.350
So in the next unit we're going to make you learn about C++ on your own.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.960
You are going to translate Python code to

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.435
C++ and there will be missing things: constructs,

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:31.334
keywords and so on that you haven't learned about.

00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:32.804
And instead of teaching all those,

00:00:32.804 --> 00:00:34.689
your task will be to go on the web,

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:39.299
find them yourselves, and bring them back into your problem exercises. Have fun.
