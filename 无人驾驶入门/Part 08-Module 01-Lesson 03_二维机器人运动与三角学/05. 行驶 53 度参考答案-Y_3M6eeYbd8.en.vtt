00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.649
If a motion of five,

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.775
corresponds to delta x of 3, and delta y of 4,

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:08.910
then a motion of 10, which is just five times two,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.550
corresponds to a delta x and delta y of six and eight.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.210
And in fact, whenever a vehicle is driving with this particular heading,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.230
delta Y over d will always be equal to four or five.
