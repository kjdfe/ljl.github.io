00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
Now that we can talk about the sides of a right triangle using words like opposite,

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:08.198
adjacent and hypotenuse, I want to talk about the ratios of those sides.

00:00:08.198 --> 00:00:12.839
The trigonometric ratios we're going to discuss are called sine, cosine and tangent.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.164
And the sine of an angle, well,

00:00:15.164 --> 00:00:18.239
that's the ratio of the opposite to the hypotenuse,

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.689
and it's abbreviated "sin".

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.340
The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent to the hypotenuse,

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.364
and it's abbreviated "cos".

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:32.789
Finally, the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite to the adjacent.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.661
And to make this all a little more clear,

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:37.935
let's just go back to our 53.13 degree triangle.

00:00:37.935 --> 00:00:40.325
And in this triangle, the sides have lengths;

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.234
the ratios three, four and five.

00:00:42.234 --> 00:00:46.394
So if I want to calculate the sine of 53.13 degrees,

00:00:46.395 --> 00:00:51.630
I need to find the opposite and divide that by the hypotenuse.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.270
So in this case, that would be four over five,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.300
which means the sine of 53.13 degrees is four over five.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.000
Can you tell me the cosine and tangent of 53.13 degrees?
