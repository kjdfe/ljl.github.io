00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.455
Welcome back. You're getting close to the final project for this course.

00:00:03.455 --> 00:00:07.799
And in this project, you'll be using data from accelerometers, rate gyros,

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.884
and odometers to reconstruct the actual XY trajectory of a self-driving car.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:15.300
And you already know how to take something like

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.810
accelerometer data and convert it to distance travel data,

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:22.379
and you also know how to use rate gyro data to a heading.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:27.614
But once you have a car pointing in a certain direction and you know how far it moves,

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:31.259
how do you figure out exactly how far it's moved in

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.969
the X direction or in the Y direction?

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.049
That is what you are going to learn in this lesson.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:41.890
How to go from a heading and a distance traveled to a change in X and Y.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.219
And to do this, we're going to need to learn the very basics of trigonometry.
