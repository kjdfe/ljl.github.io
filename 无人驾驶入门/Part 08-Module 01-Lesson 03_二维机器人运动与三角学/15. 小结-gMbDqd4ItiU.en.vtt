Congratulations. In this lesson,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:07.554
you've seen how you can use trigonometry to deconstruct motion into x and y components.

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:10.890
You'll use this ability along with your knowledge of derivatives and integrals,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.870
in the final project for this course.

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.719
In this project, you will be reconstructing the x,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.815
y trajectory of a vehicle using the raw data from its motion sensors.

00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:23.804
And note that this project is more open ended than most of the previous projects,

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:26.339
and it will not be submitted for review.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.829
Technically, this means you don't need to complete

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.574
the project to pass the Nanodegree, but I hope you do.

00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:34.374
If you get stuck or just want to discuss the project,

00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:36.600
you should feel free to use the Nanodegree Slack channel,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.000
to chat and share your code. Good luck.
