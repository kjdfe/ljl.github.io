00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
If you drive some distance D at a heading of 53.13 degrees,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.030
then your delta x will be that distance D multiplied by four over five.

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.224
And delta y will be that distance D multiplied by three over five.

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:15.834
And these multipliers are really useful.

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:19.859
They let us go from a distance traveled to delta x and delta y,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.079
but that's just one angle.

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.764
What if you're driving with a heading of 27.2 degrees, or negative 112.5?

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:32.185
How can we calculate delta x and delta y in those situations?

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:34.429
We'd like to use multipliers just like we did with the three, four,

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:38.009
five triangle, and that is where trigonometry comes in.

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.689
The trig gives us a way to easy calculate easy multipliers for any angle.

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:45.390
And we're going to come back to cars in a minute.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.005
But for now, we're going to dig deeper into triangles themselves,

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:50.670
and the first thing we're going to need is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.140
a naming convention for talking about the size of a right triangle.
