00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
So as a first example,

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.360
I'm going to make things a little easier by picking

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:06.375
a very particular angle for this car set.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:07.799
I'm going to pick theta to be

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.265
fifty three point one three degrees and D is going to be five meters.

00:00:12.265 --> 00:00:16.070
And the reason I picked these numbers is because it turns out that when a car with

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.129
a heading of fifty three point one three degrees drives forward by five meters,

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:23.024
if you measure Delta X, and Delta Y,

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:28.244
you'll find they are exactly equal to three meters and four meters.

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.570
And in fact if you ever have a right triangle were

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.149
one of the angles is fifty three point one three degrees,

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.864
the sides will have lengths in these ratios,

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:38.554
three, four, and five.

00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:41.750
What this means is that if I ever find that my car is heading of

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.850
fifty three point one three degrees and I know how far

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.109
it moves forward I'll be able to figure out Delta X and Delta Y.
