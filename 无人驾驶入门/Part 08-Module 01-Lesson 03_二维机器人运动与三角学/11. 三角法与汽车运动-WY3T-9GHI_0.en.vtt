00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Remember our initial problem?

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.279
Given the vehicles heading angle and the displacement,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.214
calculate delta x and delta y.

00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:10.910
Well, you can now solve that problem.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.595
But now, instead of thinking about a vehicle and a displacement,

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:17.054
we can just think about a right triangle.

00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:20.414
And this let's us change our problem statement to this.

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:24.134
Given the right triangles reference angle and hypotenuse,

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:28.690
calculate the length of the adjacent and opposite sides.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.505
And now that we can phrase our driving problem as a triangle problem,

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:34.140
we can solve it with trigonometry.
