00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.009
So let me demonstrate how to solve a problem like this.

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.919
Here we have a vehicle with a heading of 65 degrees and the displacement of 17 meters.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.747
I'm going to show you how I would find out the "x"

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:14.759
systematically and the first thing I'm going to do is draw the triangle.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.809
Here we have a right triangle with a reference angle of 65 degrees.

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:23.879
Next, I'm going to identify the known and unknown sides of the triangle.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:28.155
So, in this case, the known side is the hypotenuse with a length of 17 meters,

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:31.030
and the unknown side is this delta x,

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.465
and that's the adjacent side.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:39.230
Now I want to find the trigonometric ratio that relates the known and unknown sides.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:44.339
So, in this case, I'm looking for the ratio that relates the hypotenuse to the adjacent.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.710
That happens to be the cosine because cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse which,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.005
in this case, is delta x over 17.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:56.280
Now, all that's left to do is do the math.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.750
So, the first thing I want to do,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.369
now that I've cleaned things up on the left over here,

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.549
is rearrange this equation to get delta x alone.

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.334
Then, I can use Python or a calculator to look up the cosine of 65 degrees.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.814
And remember, you really have to be careful with degrees and radians here.

00:01:11.814 --> 00:01:13.819
But, once I get the answer,

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:18.064
I see the cosine of 65 degrees at 0.423.

00:01:18.064 --> 00:01:20.620
And now I just do up the multiplication

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.545
to find that delta x is seven point one eight meters.

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:29.207
Now, I want you to try to find the length of the opposite side, delta y.

00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:31.539
Go slow, be careful with your math

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.625
and feel free to rewatch this video if you find that helpful.

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:38.000
But, try your best to get it right on your first attempt.
