00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
In our previous example,

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.769
we only really cared about one of the three angles in the triangle.

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:06.719
And when we're solving trig problems,

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:09.929
we generally only care about one angle at a time.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.539
We're going to call this angle, the reference angle.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:13.914
And in the previous example,

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:17.699
reference angle was 53.13 degrees.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.437
Now I want to consider some generic reference angle, which we'll just call a theta.

00:00:21.437 --> 00:00:25.146
When we have a right triangle and some reference angle,

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:28.854
we'd like a way to refer unambiguously to the three sites,

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:32.265
and the naming convention we use in trig goes like this.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:37.049
The longest side of the right triangle is always called the hypotenuse.

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:40.489
The side on the right, the one that's opposite the reference angle,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.525
well that's just called the opposite.

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:44.647
And this last remaining side,

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:46.995
the one that's next to the reference angle,

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:50.000
well we call that the adjacent side.
