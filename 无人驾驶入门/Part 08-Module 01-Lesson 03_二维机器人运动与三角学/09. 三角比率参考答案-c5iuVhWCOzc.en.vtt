00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
Well, the cosine of 53.13 degrees is the adjacent divided by the hypotenuse.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.910
So in this case, that will be three over five or zero point six,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.820
and tangent is just opposite over adjacent,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.220
which in this case would be four over three.
