00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
When a car is pointed like this and it moves forward by D meters,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.155
its X and Y coordinates both increase by an amount that's

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.310
greater than zero but less than D. Now,

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.605
if we're going to make scatter plots of position data,

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:15.800
we need to know exactly what the values of delta X and delta

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.535
Y are and this will require some trigonometry,

00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:22.129
which is the mathematics of right triangles,

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:25.894
so it's not surprising that our first step is to find a right triangle.

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:29.480
And the right triangle I want to identify is right here.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.149
And I know it's a right triangle because two of the sides meet at a right angle.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.649
And what's amazing about trigonometry is this,

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.799
if you give me an actual numeric value for D in this angle,

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:41.884
which I'm going to call theta,

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:45.719
I can tell you exactly what delta X and delta Y will be.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.125
But before we solve this for any angle and

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:52.000
any displacement we're going to start with some very specific values.
