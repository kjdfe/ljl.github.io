00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
In the previous notebook,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.200
we only learned orientations that pointed east,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.410
north, west, or south.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.460
And because we constrained the robots suppose this way,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.580
it was easy to figure out what happened when the vehicle

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.519
moved forward by D meters for example.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.489
So in this case, if we have a car that starts here pointing

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:21.644
east and then moves to distance D to get here,

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:26.137
well, I can see that the X coordinate just increases by D,

00:00:26.138 --> 00:00:29.580
and the Y coordinate doesn't change at all.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.795
Likewise, if the car is pointing north and then moves forward by D meters,

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:37.454
then the Y coordinate will increase by D,

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:40.629
and the X coordinate will be left unchanged.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.114
But now the question is,

00:00:42.113 --> 00:00:45.974
what if the heading isn't along the X or Y axis?

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:49.215
What if the car is pointing at some weird angle like this?

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.355
Now what happens when the car moves forward by,

00:00:51.354 --> 00:00:53.125
let's say, D meters?

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:59.000
What can you say about the value for delta X and for delta Y in a situation like this?
