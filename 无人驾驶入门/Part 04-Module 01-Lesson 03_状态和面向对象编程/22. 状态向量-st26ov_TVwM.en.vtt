00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
So far you've seen that,

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.695
the state of a car contains multiple values which we've been putting into a Python list.

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:11.304
But these values are typically contained in one data type, a state vector.

00:00:11.304 --> 00:00:14.339
A vector is similar to a list in Python in that it contains

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.059
multiple values but they are mathematically very different.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:19.859
A vector is a kind of matrix,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.675
which for now you can think of as a grid of numbers.

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:25.039
And matrices are a math data type,

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.975
similar to something like an integer or a float.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.129
And similar to an integer or a float,

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.635
we can multiply matrices,

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:32.789
we can scale them,

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.000
add two of them together and so on.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.825
This is called linear algebra,

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:41.495
and linear algebra will come up again and again in self-driving car systems.

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:46.419
It's in everything from car movement to deep learning algorithms and image analysis.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.130
In this section, we'll see how state vectors and matrices can be used

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.000
together to help us efficiently predict a new state and localize a car.
