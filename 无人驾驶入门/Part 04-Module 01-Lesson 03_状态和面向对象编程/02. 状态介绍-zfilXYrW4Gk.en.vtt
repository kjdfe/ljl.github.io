00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.044
When you localize a car you're interested in only the car's position and its movement.

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:08.490
This is often called the State of the car.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.435
The state of any system is a set of values that we care about.

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:14.269
In the cases you've been working with,

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.085
the state of the car includes the car's current position,

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:19.019
X, and its velocity.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.750
In code this looks something like this.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.629
The State of the car gives us most of the information we

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:28.019
need to form predictions about a car's future location.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.505
And in this lesson we'll see how to represent state and how it changes over time.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.655
For example, say that our world is a one-lane road

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:39.179
and we know that the current position of our car is at the start of this road,

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.039
at the zero meter mark.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.780
We also know the car's velocity,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.035
it's moving forward at a rate of 50 meters per second.

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:48.494
These values are its initial state.

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:52.339
What do you think the state of the car will be after three seconds elapse?
