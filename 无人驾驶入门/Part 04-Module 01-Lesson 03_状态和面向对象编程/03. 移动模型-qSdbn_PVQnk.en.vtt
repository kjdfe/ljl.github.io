00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Let's take a closer look at the last example.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.000
The initial state of the car is at

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.224
the zero meter position and it's moving forward at a velocity of 50 meters per second.

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:13.964
Let's assume that our car keeps moving forward at a constant rate.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:16.260
Every second it moves 50 meters,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.109
so after three seconds it will have reached

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.259
the 150 meter mark and its velocity will not have changed.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.645
That's what a constant velocity means.

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:27.439
It's new predicted the state will be at the position

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.755
150 meters and with the velocity still equal to 50 meters per second.

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:36.710
This is a reasonable prediction and we made it using just; one,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.134
the initial state of the car and two,

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:42.575
an assumption that the car is moving at a constant velocity.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:47.160
This last assumption can be mathematically represented by the physics equation;

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:50.444
distance traveled = velocity*time.

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:52.460
This equation is also referred to as

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.195
a motion model and there are many ways to model motion.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:58.710
This model assumes constant velocity.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.200
In our example, we're moving at a constant velocity of 50 meters/second for

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.090
three seconds and we formed

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.465
our new position estimate with the constant velocity equation,

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:13.390
150 meters = 50 meters/second * 3 seconds.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.707
In order to predict where a car will be at a future point in time,

00:01:16.707 --> 00:01:19.275
you have to rely on a motion model.

00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:22.605
It's important to note that no motion model is perfect.

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:25.280
It's a challenge to account for outside factors like wind or

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.415
elevation or even things like tire slippage and other uncertainties.

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:33.315
But these models are still very important for localization.

00:01:33.314 --> 00:01:35.599
Next, you'll be asked to write a function that

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.059
uses a motion model to predict a new state.
