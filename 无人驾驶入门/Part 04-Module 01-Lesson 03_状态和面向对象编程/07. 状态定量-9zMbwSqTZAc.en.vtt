00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
Now you've seen two examples of car motion models.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:07.655
In the first example we assumed our car was moving at a constant velocity.

00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:09.960
But in the second example we said that the car was

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.815
slowing down with a constant acceleration.

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:15.839
And after three seconds had elapsed we ended up with

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.550
different estimates for our car's state depending on which motion model we relied on.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.730
In the case where the car was slowing down we had to include

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.449
an acceleration value in our calculations in order to predict where it would move.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.890
And so we also added this value to our car's state.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.259
In fact, how many variables the state of our car

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:37.545
contains depends on what motion model we use.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:39.554
For a constant velocity model,

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:41.774
position and velocity will suffice.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:46.634
But for constant acceleration you'll need to include an acceleration value as well,

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:48.524
and these are all just models.

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:51.479
For any state you should always choose the smallest set of

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.000
values that you'll need to work with your chosen motion model.
