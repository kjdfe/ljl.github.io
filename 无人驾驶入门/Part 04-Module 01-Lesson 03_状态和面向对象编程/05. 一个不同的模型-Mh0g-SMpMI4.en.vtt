00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.995
Now, what if I gave you a more complex motion example?

00:00:03.995 --> 00:00:08.150
And I told you that our car starts at the same point at the zero meter mark,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.234
and it's moving 50 meters per second forward,

00:00:11.234 --> 00:00:16.219
but it's also slowing down at a rate of 20 meters per second squared.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.015
That means that every second the velocity decreases by 20 meters per second.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.815
This value is referred to as acceleration.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.460
Acceleration, in this case,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.420
equals negative 20 meters per second squared.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.230
This acceleration means that if the car starts at a speed of 50 meters per second,

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:38.239
at the next second it will be going 50 minus 20 or 30 meters per second.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.510
And that the next second it will be going 30 minus 20,

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.534
or 10 meters per second.

00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:45.803
The slowing down is also continuous,

00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:49.048
which means it happens gradually over time.

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.390
For the next couple quizzes,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.700
I want you to keep in mind this question.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.185
Where will the car be after three seconds with this initial state?

00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:58.594
I also want to ask you,

00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:01.719
what variables do you need to answer this question?

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.105
In other words, what values should be included in the state?

00:01:05.105 --> 00:01:09.000
And what motion model should we use to solve this problem?
