Great job getting this far.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.110
Now you've seen that we can transform the state of a car using matrix multiplication.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.644
This kind of linear algebra can be used to update

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:12.660
multiple state variables in just one line of code

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.150
and this becomes really useful when you're working with

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.740
big data sets and variables that represent a three dimensional world.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:24.269
Next you'll see how linear algebra is used to create a two dimensional Kalman filter.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.658
In the process you'll learn more about matrix operations and notation,

00:00:28.658 --> 00:00:31.245
and you'll be one step closer to creating an algorithm that

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:34.000
is actually used to localize self-driving cars.
