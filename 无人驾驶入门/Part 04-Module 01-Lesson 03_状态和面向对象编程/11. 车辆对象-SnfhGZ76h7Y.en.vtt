00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660
So here I'll show you how to interact with

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.990
a car object that can keep track of its own state.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.935
First, you'll see some import statements

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.425
and some code that we'll go through in detail soon.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:13.195
But before we dive into the code that makes up an object,

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:15.300
we'll learn how to interact with it.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.730
So next you'll see some initial variables.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.644
First a world, and then some variables that should look familiar,

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:24.320
and initial position and velocity.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.269
This time, the position is in two dimensions, Y and X,

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:34.125
and the velocity is also broken down into vertical and horizontal components VY and VX.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:35.939
I'll make sure to run both of these,

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:39.339
then to create a car which I'll name Carla.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.995
I have to say car_dot_car and pass in some initial state.

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:48.699
So I'm passing in some YX position and velocity.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.605
And lastly I'm passing in a world which is just a 2D array,

00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:55.559
and I'll print out Carla's initial state.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.815
You'll notice that I can access Carla's state by saying Carla_dot_state,

00:00:59.814 --> 00:01:03.289
and we see that the initial position is at zero zero,

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.030
and the initial velocity is zero one,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.625
which means it has some horizontal velocity to the right.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.109
Now this car object,

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:14.019
Carla, has some visualization code too.

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:19.539
And we can see where the car is at any given point using the display world function.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.920
I can say Carla_dot_display_world,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.495
and when I run this code,

00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:28.865
I'll see the location of Carla and the size of the 2D world.

00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:30.939
Now, what else can Carla do?

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.734
Well, we can tell Carla to move by saying Carla_dot_move,

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:39.015
and Carla will move one grid cell in the direction of the initial velocity,

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:41.299
which in this case is towards the right.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.129
Let's test this movement by displaying the world again,

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:47.670
and we can see that Carla has moved one space to the right.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.465
After this movement, we can also track the change in Carla's state,

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:55.335
and I can print out its value using Carla_dot_state again.

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:58.625
And we can see that the state has actually updated.

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:01.364
The position has moved one grid cell to the right,

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:03.629
and the velocity remains constant.

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:07.319
So somehow Carla is keeping track of her own state.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.984
And what if we move a couple more times?

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:12.370
Let's track the change in state,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.439
and we see that we've moved two more to the right, zero_comma_three.

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.289
And we can see the movement on a map of the world by

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:23.344
calling Carla_dot_display_world once more.

00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:26.729
So we know Carla's state updates automatically.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.185
Carla can also turn left.

00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:33.960
So let's tell Carla to turn left and move one space.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.064
And let's display the world.

00:02:37.064 --> 00:02:43.025
We can see that Carla turns left at this spot and actually circles around the world.

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:48.390
And if we print out Carla's state by saying Carla_state is string Carla_dot_state,

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.409
we see that both the position and the velocity have changed.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.585
Our position is three_three,

00:02:54.585 --> 00:02:56.620
which is reflected in our grid,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.615
and VY is now negative_one and VX is zero.

00:03:00.615 --> 00:03:03.054
This means that there is no horizontal velocity,

00:03:03.054 --> 00:03:05.640
there's only a negative vertical velocity,

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.174
which means Carla's moving up our grid world.

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:11.745
Now moving and turning left are all Carla can do for now,

00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:15.000
but we'll soon see how to add to our list of capabilities.
