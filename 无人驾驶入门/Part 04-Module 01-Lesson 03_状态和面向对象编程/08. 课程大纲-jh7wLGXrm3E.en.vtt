00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.945
The one unifying theme in this lesson is representing and predicting state.

00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:07.890
But there are two threads that we'll use to explore this idea.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:10.230
On the programming side, we'll use something called

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.304
object-oriented programming as a way to represent state in code.

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:15.629
We'll use variables to represent

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.199
state values and we'll create functions to change those values.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.643
On the mathematical side,

00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:24.589
we'll use vectors and matrices to keep track of state and change it.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.759
We'll learn all the necessary math notation and code,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.370
as we learn more about predicting the state of the car.
