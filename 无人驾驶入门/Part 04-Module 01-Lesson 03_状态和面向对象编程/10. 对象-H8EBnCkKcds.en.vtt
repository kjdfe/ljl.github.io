00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.556
Objects hold a state,

00:00:01.556 --> 00:00:05.910
they hold a group of variables also known as properties and functions.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.280
You can imagine an object like a box.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.429
And within that box are variables that define the state of

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.689
an object like the position and velocity of a car object.

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.780
Objects also hold functions that tell us what the object can do,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.998
like can the car move and turn and so on.

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:24.054
But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:27.030
Let's first see an example of an object in action.
