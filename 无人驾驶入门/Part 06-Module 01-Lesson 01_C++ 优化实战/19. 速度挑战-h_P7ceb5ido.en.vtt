00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.094
Okay, now you'll learn some of the lower level features of C++,

00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:08.650
and thanks for enduring this with us.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.120
Now comes the real challenge.

00:00:11.118 --> 00:00:14.954
How fast can you make your history on filter?

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:18.780
I want to challenge you to use all those features to

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.880
write the fastest possible C++ implementation,

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:24.434
and once you found it,

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:25.890
go to the select channel,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.109
tell others how fast the solution is,

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.429
and compare codes, because that's where the real fun lies.
